## key
- **<font color="red">buildings with no plans:</font>** these are vacant, pending sale, or for some other reason unlikely to be used much without substantial rehabilitation.
- **<font color="orange">buildings with plans:</font>** these have some plans, but have active or likely zoning cases left to overcome first
- **<font color="green">buildings with entitlement:</font>** these have plans and are cleared of all zoning hurdles (either getting approval or being a by-right project to start with); a lot of buildings go on sale at this point to a buyer who plans to do the building, so a building may end up parked in this state for a while
- **<font color="blue">under construction:</font>** these are that have actively began construction
- **<font color="purple">recently constructed:</font>** new buildings, probably good to go for a while
