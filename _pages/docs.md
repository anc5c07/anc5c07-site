This is a collection of written works I've issued or contributed to. I often take these formal issuances to provide commentary on the record for tangentially related issues, such as bringing things back to 5C07 for issues just outside, or pointing out other places where certain mitigations are also needed. More info on common types of letters, and my general practice in broadening their scope for the sake of larger advocacy goals, are below.

## Letters on Behalf of ANC 5C
If ANC 5C has passed a resolution on a matter and authorized me to represent the Commission (either specifically, among a list of Commissioners, or authorizing all Commissioners), I might issue letters on behalf of the Commission on a matter.

## Amplified Sound letters
When a person or organization applies for a permit to host an event in a DPR-managed park (such as Langdon Park), and they request an endorsement for amplified sound (such as playing music through speakers), they are instructed to seek approval from the Commissioner of the Single-Member District containing the park. While DPR may still choose to issue the endorsement absent consent from the Commissioner, the process is much easier once this approval has been issued.

I take this opportunity to echo DPR's own permit regulations, as well as highlight shortcomings of them for the benefit of DPR, the community, and the permit applicant. This has recently focused on DPR's unclear position on drivers bringing cars into the park, which they [finally clarified on 8/31/2023](https://x.com/anc5c07/status/1697349955453866328?s=20) with new bollards and signage.

## DDOT NOI responses
DDOT issues an "NOI" (Notice of Intent) for any projects, to make the available for public comment. Commissioner (and, even moreso, Commission) feedback is given special weight. For these letters, I frequently point out other places where similar mitigations are necessary, or advocate for why subsequent phases to go further than the noticed action should follow as soon as possible.

## Zoning case responses
This is feedback to the Zoning Commission or Board of Zoning Adjustment for applications on zoning relief. I frequently take this opportunity to mention I would have supported other relief too, had the applicant been seeking it.

## Public Space case responses
This is feedback to the Public Space Committee for applications for public space permitting.

## Settlement Agreements
These are contractual agreements between parties (frequently Advisory Neighborhood Commissions) and alcohol/cannabis license holders. While the provisions of these are mostly borrowed from existing documents, I do occassionally draft (and vet through ABCA) new provisions as part of creating Settlement Agreements, as I did for Aurora Market's multimodal transportation encouragement provision.

## Sign-on Letters
A relatively new tool in the ANC toolkit is sign-on letters. Like solo/SMD letters, these do not formally have the weight of Commission resolutions, but can be executed more quickly (outside of the routine meeting cycle) and can demonstrate broad support across DC without struggling to synchronize text across multiple Commissions, varying concerns, and different meeting cycles along with shifting conditions. I frequently sign on to others' letters, or solicit narrow or broad support from others on things I've written. This process frequently involves collaboration to tweak language accordingly to secure broader support, further enhancing the end product.
