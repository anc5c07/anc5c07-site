# Traffic Safety
My top priority is carefully tracking the installation of traffic safety improvements in our neighborhood on a block-by-block and intersection-by-intersection basis. I'll create a dashboard to track investigations and incidents within our SMD, so we can keep broad and persistent pressure on DDOT to supply us with the improvements we deserve, with multiple visualization options (map, table) and some provision for exporting to print for broader distribution.

That said, it's unfortunate that this critically important issue has to be approached through squeaky-wheel agitating for every piecemeal improvement. As Commissioner, I'll introduce resolutions in 5C to support Council legislation for broader improvements, including the [Walk Without Worry Amendment Act](https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B24-0566) and the [Safe Routes to School Expansion Regulation Amendment Act](https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B24-0565). Once enacted, I'll work to make sure our neighborhood gets the improvements the new laws are meant to guarantee.

## Streetscape projects
There are many stalled streetscape projects for the arterials running along/near our SMD, including:
- [Rhode Island Ave. NE Streetscape Master Plan](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/rhode-island-avenue-ne-streetscape-master-plan)
- [South Dakota Avenue Transportation and Streetscape Study](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/south-dakota-avenue-transportation-and-streetscape-study)
- [New York Avenue Streetscape and Trail Project
](https://www.newyorkavenueproject.com/), recently repackaged as the [New York Avenue NE Roadmap](https://planning.dc.gov/NYAroadmap)

I'll work to raise awareness of these project and attempt to build pressure to finally see them through, and hopefully go further to incorporate dedicated and protected bus/bike infrastructure.

# More Transportation options
Our neighborhood deserves more choice in how we get around, including but not limited to:
- more frequent bus service on all lines serving us (83, 86, T14, T18, H6, E2, and B2)
- restoring the lines we've lost during the pandemic (G9, B8, B9)
- having Rhode Island Ave on the (DDOT Bus Priority Plan)[https://ddot.dc.gov/page/bus-priority-plan-and-resources] *with a date*
- protection on the 18th St. bike lanes, and improved connection to the West Virginia Ave. protected bike lanes
- extending the protected bike lanes on Franklin St. eastward towards our neighborhood

# More Retail/Restaurants
Our neighborhood has had many business gains and losses over the last decade. We can all list Rhode Island Ave. businesses that have opened and given us great and walkable neighborhood destinations, but also a number of them that have since closed. I want to give businesses the support they need to stay open, as well as encourage the construction of retail space in new buildings as they're planned, to keep a pipeline of new retail spaces available as older ones undergo maintenance cycles.

# More Public Amenities
We're lucky to have received a substantial rebuild of Langdon Park in 2013 and of Woodridge Library in 2016. Right now, Langdon Park is receiving additional improvement in the [Hamlin Street LID Stormwater Retrofit Project](https://doee.dc.gov/service/hamlin-street-lid-stormwater-retrofit-project) and the [Langdon Park forest patch trail](https://caseytrees.org/2022/04/notes-from-the-field-langdon-park/).

While we enjoy those new feature of the park (and everything else going on there!), we should turn our sights to the Langdon Park Recreation Center, which is due for improvement. I'll advocate for bumping this up in priority as much as possible. I'll also advocate for improvements to some existing amenities, including improving the surfacing of the playground and of the dog park.

# More Housing
A net increase in neighbors will support demand for all of the above, and we should build for and welcome them. Our neighborhood is poised for a lot of construction over the next few years. I'll advocate for new housing that reflects the future we want to see for our neighborhood; mixed-use, transit-oriented, and diverse in size, shape, and pricing. This will benefit incoming residents, as well as those with changing needs who we want to keep here in our community.
