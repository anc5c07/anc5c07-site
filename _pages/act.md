I try to incorporate chances to advocate to targeted decisionmakers (or their public-facing staff) for any pressing issues we're facing as a community. Here are some things you can take action on right now. Any of these action items can also be turned into a petition if you want to grab even more support quickly from neighbors.

|act on|if you care about|
|---|---|
|[The HAWK signal at RIA/Thayer](/issues/ria-thayer/#community-action)|traffic safety in our neighborhood|
|[2001 Rhode Island Ave NE](/issues/2001ria/#community-action)|more homes and retail spaces on RIA|

#### tips for a good letter
- **Be respectful;** use honorifics instead of first names, and thank folks for their service no matter how you may feel about it
- **Be specific;** always use (and bold) specific Service Request/Work Order numbers to avoid adding a layer of research to follow-through
- **Add emotion/color** in the form of your experiences (but don't lose the thread on the specific action being advocated for)
