The Single-Member District (SMD) **5C07** is within Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) **5C**, in DC's **Ward 5**. It contains the northern portions of the Langdon neighborhood. As neighborhood boundaries are not formally defined, some might also consider portions to be part of Woodridge, Brookland, or Brentwood with varying levels of agreement.

## boundaries

5C07 is bounded by:
- **Rhode Island Ave NE** to the northwest
- **Evarts St. NE** to the south
- **the B&O railroad tracks** (i.e. those carrying the MARC Camden line and staying north of Bladensburg Rd. NE) to the southeast
- **24th St. NE** bounds a small triangle south of Evarts, to the west

### redistricting
The November 2022 elections will take place against [the new ANC boundaries](https://planning.dc.gov/2023-anc-smd-boundaries), which will take effect in January 2023 around the time the winners of that election are sworn in.

Experienced voters in the neighborhood should take note that **5C07 changed significantly in the 2022 redistricting process**, moving both south and west. Effective January 2023 and applying to the November 2022 ANC elections:
- Residents of **5C07** (from 2013-2022) who live *north of Rhode Island Ave. NE* will live in **5B06**
- Residents of **5C06** (from 2013-2022) who live *west of 17th St. NE between Rhode Island Ave. NE and Evarts St. NE* will live in **5C07**
- Residents of **5C02** (from 2013-2022) who live *north of the railroad tracks and between 24th St. NE and South Dakota Ave. NE* will live in **5C07**
