This is a work in progress! Check back for updates on understanding the above map and instructions for helping push these investigations forward. Every email pulls a little bit more work out of DDOT.

In the meantime, definitely reach to me through the contact methods below if you want to inquire about the latest status of anything on the map.

<!--## key
- **<font color="red">buildings with no plans:</font>** these are vacant, pending sale, or for some other reason unlikely to be used much without substantial rehabilitation.
- **<font color="orange">buildings with plans:</font>** these have some plans, but have active or likely zoning cases left to overcome first
- **<font color="green">buildings with zoning entitlement:</font>** these have plans and are cleared of all zoning hurdles (either getting approval or being a by-right project to start with); a lot of buildings go on sale at this point to a buyer who plans to do the construction, so a building may end up parked in this state for a while; there may substantial details and room for public input/benefit as part of public space permitting and/or public financing circumstances
- **<font color="blue">under construction:</font>** these are buildings that have actively began construction
- **<font color="purple">recently constructed:</font>** new buildings, probably good to go for a while
- **<font color="teal">preservation areas:</font>** areas where buildings should be deterred for environmental or other reasons -->
