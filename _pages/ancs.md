### What are Advisory Neighborhood Commission(er)s?
> *The following content is borrowed from [Commissioner Costello](https://anc5b05.com/faqs) with permission, because I can't improve on it.*

First established in 1976, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions are non-partisan, neighborhood bodies made up of locally-elected representatives called Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners. ANCs were established to bring government closer to the people, and to bring the people closer to government. Commissioners serve two-year terms without pay. 

A Commissioner’s main job is to be their neighborhood’s official voice in advising the District government on issues affecting their community. Although District agencies are not required to follow an ANC’s advice, they are required by law to give an ANC’s recommendations “great weight.” Moreover, [District law](https://code.dccouncil.us/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-309.10.html) says that agencies cannot take any action that will significantly affect a neighborhood—including zoning, streets, recreation, education, social services, sanitation, planning, safety, budget, and health services—unless they give the affected ANC 30 days’ advance notice.  

Commissioners may also initiate recommendations for improving city services, conduct neighborhood improvement programs, and monitor resident complaints.  

### Give it to me in surgical/technical terms
The District of Columbia is split into eight wards. Each Ward is split into a variable number (4-7) of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) lettered A up to G, which are further split into a variable number ([2-12](https://twitter.com/ANCJonah/status/1444102088187908096?s=20)) of Single Member Districts (SMDs). ANCs are identified by Ward and letter (e.g. 5D for the nominally fourth of Ward 5) and SMDs are identified by ANC and SMD number (e.g. 5D03 for the third SMD within ANC 5D). The boundaries of all of these subdivisions are subject to change in response to each US Census; the upcoming 2022 elections will occur against new boundaries established in 2022 in response to the 2020 Census numbers.
