## What are Advisory Neighborhood Commission(er)s?
>The following content is borrowed from [Commissioner Costello](https://anc5b05.com/faqs) with permission, because I can't improve on it.

First established in 1976, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions are non-partisan, neighborhood bodies made up of locally-elected representatives called Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners. ANCs were established to bring government closer to the people, and to bring the people closer to government. Commissioners serve two-year terms without pay. 

A Commissioner‚Äôs main job is to be their neighborhood‚Äôs official voice in advising the District government on issues affecting their community. Although District agencies are not required to follow an ANC‚Äôs advice, they are required by law to give an ANC‚Äôs recommendations ‚Äúgreat weight.‚Äù Moreover, [District law](https://code.dccouncil.us/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-309.10.html) says that agencies cannot take any action that will significantly affect a neighborhood - including zoning, streets, recreation, education, social services, sanitation, planning, safety, budget, and health services - unless they give the affected ANC 30 days‚Äô advance notice.  

Commissioners may also initiate recommendations for improving city services, conduct neighborhood improvement programs, and monitor resident complaints.

## Lexicon
Advisory Neighborhood Commission
: *(aka **ANC**, **Commission**)*
: identified by DC Ward and a letter (e.g. **5C**), a neighborhood body and [the political boundaries](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/advisory-neighborhood-commissions-from-2023/explore) over which it exercises *great weight* in DC Government affairs. While the [eight Wards of DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/wards-from-2022) are generally redistricted to equal population after every decennial US Census, they are not split into the same number of Commissions

Single Member District
: *(aka **SMD**)*
: identified by the Commission and a two-digit number (e.g. **5C07**), a district within a Commission's boundaries that elects one member of that Commission; while Commissions around DC may contain anywhere from 2-12 members, SMDs are (somewhat) strictly kept to 2000¬±100 residents (per the preceding decennial US Census).

Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner
: *(aka also **ANC**, **Commissioner**)*
: an elected member of a Commission, representing one SMD within the Commission. While Commissioners will focus on, and be deferred to regarding, issues within their SMD; it's only the Commission itself that formally gets *great weight*, exercised on the boundaries of the Commission as a whole.

great weight
: ü§∑üèΩ, but it's in the law. Commissions formally vote on resolutions of support or opposition to cases before various DC agencies and decision-making bodies. In the absence of a resolution, somebody with business before one of those entities would need to establish work was done to brief the relevant Commission and gain its support. Commissions may also vote for resolutions regarding pending or desired legislative/executive action, which can inform Councilmembers and the Mayor of the will of their constituents.
