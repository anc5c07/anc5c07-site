### What are Advisory Neighborhood Commission(er)s?
The District of Columbia is split into eight wards. Each Ward is split into a variable number (4-7) of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) lettered A up to G, which are further split into a variable number ([2-12](https://twitter.com/ANCJonah/status/1444102088187908096?s=20)) of Single Member Districts (SMDs). ANCs are identified by Ward and letter (e.g. 5D for the nominally fourth of Ward 5) and SMDs are identified by ANC and SMD number (e.g. 5D03 for the third SMD within ANC 5D). The boundaries of all of these subdivisions are subject to change in response to each US Census; the upcoming 2022 elections will occur against new boundaries established in 2022 in response to the 2020 Census numbers.

Residents of each SMD elect an ANC Commissioner who then serves within the SMD and on committee with the broader ANC. ANC Commissioner is a voluntary, unpaid, difficult, and important job. You can learn about it [here](https://anc.dc.gov/page/about-ancs) and [here](https://ggwash.org/view/43008/advisory-neighborhood-commissions-explained). Unfortunately, these positions often go vacant, or [worse](https://twitter.com/PritaPiekara/status/1445941469999730688?s=20).
