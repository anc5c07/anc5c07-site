I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'd do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page.

### The timeline:
- **NOW (7/28 update):** I've secured ballot access, but am still collecting signatures for buffer when I get a chance. It's unclear that we'll have a competitive race on our hands, though I'm still waiting and prepared for one. If you or anyone you know might want to run in some of the nearby seats (particularly 5B03 and 5C06, where nobody has declared yet), please put them in touch with me!
- **August 10th:** Ballot petitions are due. Officially, I'll need 25 signatures of duly registered voters within the SMD's boundaries. Practically speaking, I'll want a buffer of... as many as I can get.
- **late Sept/early Oct** Mail/Dropbox ballots [should be received](https://twitter.com/Vote4DC/status/1554102744436310017) in the mail by all registered voters.
- **November 8th:** the *END* of voting. As with the last few election cycles, folks will have the chance to vote by mail, dropbox, any Early Voting Center, or any Election Day Voting Center. BOE has not finalized voting center/dropbox locations or dates for early voting, but the draft information is [available for review and comment](https://www.dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections). I expect most of us will be voting at the dropbox in front of **Woodridge Library** or at the new early/Election Day voting center slated for the **Woodridge Library community room**.

**Note:** While the Langdon Park Rec Center was both an early and day-of voting center during the Primaries in June, it is not slated to be a voting center at all this round; but the Woodridge Library is just a walk through Langdon Park away!
