I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'd do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page. You can find writeups on specific cases and meeting summaries on the [Issues](/issues/) page.

## The Election
- **Voting has begun!** If you haven't received your ballot in the mail by now (it just so happens I haven't either), be prepared to vote in-person starting 10/31; vote [by COB Tuesday 11/8](https://dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections)!
- **Woodridge Library** is your one-stop shop for dropbox, Early in-person, and Election Day voting needs!
- **I'm unopposed on the 5C07 ballot**; nobody is attempting a write-in campaign that I know of, either.
- **That said**, I've also been endorsed by [Greater Greater Washington](https://ggwash.org/view/86902/our-2022-advisory-neighborhood-commissioner-endorsements-in-ward-5), [DC Voters for Animals](https://twitter.com/DCV4A/status/1574857157425696789?s=20&t=h3TDkZ2IX1wkQIJ4o5FfIw), [former Council Chairwoman candidate Erin Palmer](https://erinfordc.medium.com/%EF%B8%8Fendorsement-alert-%EF%B8%8F-8b3c1e3f881b), and [dANCgerous](https://dancgerous.wordpress.com/).
- There are **competitive/consequential** elections nearby and you can donate and volunteer! This includes in [5B05](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/costello-for-5b05), [5B07](https://donorbox.org/justineforanc5b07), [5C04](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/shawn-nelson-1), [5D06](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dellesky-for-anc-5d06-1), [5E02](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/nicole-mcentee-for-5e02-1), [5E04](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/huma-imtiaz-for-anc-5e04-1), 5F04, 5F05, and [5F07](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/michele-keegan-for-anc-5f07--eckington-1). There are also competitive races for [Ward 5 SBOE](https://www.hendersonforward5.com/support) and [Council At-Large](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/elissa2022?refcode=webheader).
- If you didn't get our ballot *and* **you aren't sure what SMD you live in**, check the [OpenANC project](http://openanc.org).

Beyond the election, I'm open to any and all thoughts on how you'd like to be informed about ANC matters and the priorities I should focus on. Check out my [Priorities](/priorities/) and [Issues](/issues/) pages and let me know what works for you and what doesn't.
