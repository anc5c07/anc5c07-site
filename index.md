I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'd do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page. You can find writeups on specific cases and meeting summaries on the [Issues](/issues/) page.

### The timeline:
- **NOW (8/8 update):** Planning to make my last signature dropoff on Tuesday 8/9. Feeling okay about my signature count, but if anyone hasn't signed and would like a porch visit on Monday evening or Tuesday morning, I'm always up for it! Still unclear we have a competitive race; we can't know for sure until Thursday 8/11. Even if we don't, there are hugely consequential nearby races that I'm ready to help support, while I also continue hearing from folks in 5C07 and start the work early.
- **August 10th:** Ballot petitions are due. Officially, I'll need 25 signatures of duly registered voters within the SMD's boundaries. Practically speaking, I'll want a buffer of... as many as I can get.
- **late Sept/early Oct:** Mail/Dropbox ballots [should be received](https://twitter.com/Vote4DC/status/1554102744436310017) in the mail by all registered voters. These can be mailed, or, as I'd recommend, dropped off at a dropbox (such as the one in front of Woodridge Library).
- **early-mid October:** Dropboxes will open to receive those ballots.
- **late Oct/early Nov:** Early Voting centers will open; any DC voter can vote at any DC voting center. In 5C07, the Woodridge Library community room is tentatively planned to be our local Early Voting center.
- **November 8th:** the *END* of voting. All Early Voting centers will be open with additional hours; there will be additional Election Day voting centers (such as, tentatively, Burroughs Elementary nearby). Any DC voter can vote at any DC voting center.

BOE has not finalized voting center/dropbox locations or dates for Early Voting, but the draft information is [available for review and comment](https://www.dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections). I expect most of us will be voting at the dropbox in front of **Woodridge Library** or at the new Early Voting/Election Day voting center slated for the **Woodridge Library community room**.

While the Langdon Park Rec Center was both an Early Voting and Election Day voting center during the Primaries in June, it is not slated to be a voting center at all this round; but the Woodridge Library is just a walk through Langdon Park away!
