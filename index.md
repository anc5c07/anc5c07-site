I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'd do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page. You can find writeups on specific cases and meeting summaries on the [Issues](/issues/) page.

### The timeline:
- **NOW (8/8 update):** Planning to make my last signature dropoff on Tuesday 8/9. Feeling okay about my signature count, but if anyone hasn't signed and would like a porch visit on Monday evening or Tuesday morning, I'm always up for it! Still unclear we have a competitive race; we can't know for sure until Thursday 8/11. Even if we don't, there are hugely consequential nearby races that I'm ready to help support, while I also continue hearing from folks in 5C07 and start the work early.
- **August 10th:** Ballot petitions are due. Officially, I'll need 25 signatures of duly registered voters within the SMD's boundaries. Practically speaking, I'll want a buffer of... as many as I can get.
- **late Sept/early Oct** Mail/Dropbox ballots [should be received](https://twitter.com/Vote4DC/status/1554102744436310017) in the mail by all registered voters.
- **November 8th:** the *END* of voting. As with the last few election cycles, folks will have the chance to vote by mail, dropbox, any Early Voting Center, or any Election Day Voting Center. BOE has not finalized voting center/dropbox locations or dates for early voting, but the draft information is [available for review and comment](https://www.dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections). I expect most of us will be voting at the dropbox in front of **Woodridge Library** or at the new early/Election Day voting center slated for the **Woodridge Library community room**.

**Note:** While the Langdon Park Rec Center was both an early and day-of voting center during the Primaries in June, it is not slated to be a voting center at all this round; but the Woodridge Library is just a walk through Langdon Park away!
