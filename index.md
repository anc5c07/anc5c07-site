I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'd do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page. You can find writeups on specific cases and meeting summaries on the [Issues](/issues/) page.

## The Election
There is now a comprehensive timeline up at the DC BOE website on the [2022 Elections page](https://dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections).

### tl;dr
ANC candidate declarations are over and I'll be unopposed on the 5C07 ballot, but there are competitive/consequential elections just outside our boundaries. Actual voting runs from early October and ends on **November 8th**. There will once again be mailed ballots for all, dropboxes, Early Voting centers, and the option to vote at any Election Day voting center. **Woodridge Library** will host all three voting options.

### Campaign Status
I dropped off 43 signatures in total for ballot access, to meet a minimum requirement of 25 after any challenges. I appreciate everyone's support, the many conversations about the neighborhood, and the miles I walked making the rounds!

The declaration period is over, and nobody else pulled papers, let alone submitted signatures, in 5C07. We can exhale a bit, but there will still be a 10-day signature challenge period, the potential for a write-in campaign, and the important work of earning neighbors' trust in the next few months (and beyond).

I'll also continue writing up my [Issues](/issues/) pages, with meeting summaries and calls to action to advance projects around the SMD and beyond, building the dashboard to track concerns/service requests, and submitting TSIs that will conclude after I take office.

### The Horserace
Meanwhile, there are some competitive elections nearby with major consequences for what we can get done in 5C and with 5B (and A/D/E/F where we all spend plenty of time); for folks who are interested in a horserace, we have plenty of that ahead of us. I'll write up some specifics soon, but feel free to reach out for more details on competitive nearby races; if you're reading this from outside of [5C07](/5c07/), you may be voting in one!

Today, the best thing you can do is familiarize yourself with the (*new!*) maps, think about where your network lives, and encourage your friends to do the same. You can do this by checking the [OpenANC project](http://openanc.org), the [official tool](https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/lookup/index.html?appid=d83784aad3f247d39df1a92422a9df25), the [static maps](https://planning.dc.gov/2023-anc-smd-boundaries), and/or just reaching out to me at the social media options below!
