I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm running for [ANC](/ancs/) in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city a safe, vibrant, and welcoming place for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. I still have some more content to write on these pages about myself, my priorities, and the issues currently in front of ANC 5C, but I'm sharing this site now because it's never too early to do the work.

The timeline:
- **NOW:** Folks within the SMD that want to help can [check their voter registration](https://www.dcboe.org/Voters/Register-To-Vote/Check-Voter-Registration-Status) (note: it doesn't matter whether you're registered with a party or which one!) and check if they're in [the new 5C07 boundaries](/5c07/), and encourage your neighbors to do the same.
- **July 20th:** ANC ballot petitions are released by the Board of Elections. I'll be ready to meet folks wherever they are, and will be scheduling some time at my favorite neighborhood hangs to be available as well, so I can get y'all to sign.
- **August 10th:** Ballot petitions are due. Officially, I'll need 25 signatures of duly registered voters within the SMD's boundaries. Practically speaking, I'll want a buffer of... as many as I can get.
- **November 8th:** the END of voting. As with the last few cycles, folks will have the chance to vote by mail, dropbox, any Early Voting Center, or any day-of Precinct. The exact locations and dates for early voting are not final, but the draft information is [available for review and commenting](https://www.dcboe.org/Elections/2022-Elections). I expect most of us will be voting at the dropbox in front of **Woodridge Library** or at the **Langdon Park Rec Center**.

*[SMD]: Single-Member District
