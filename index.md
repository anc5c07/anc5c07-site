I'm [VJ Kapur](/vj/) and I'm humbled to be your [ANC](/ancs/)-elect in [5C07](/5c07/). I want to make our neighborhood and city safe, vibrant, and welcoming for long-term, new, and future neighbors alike. You can read more about what I'll do as Commissioner on the [Priorities](/priorities/) page. You can find writeups on specific cases and meeting summaries on the [Issues](/issues/) page.

## The Work
I'm open to any and all thoughts on how you'd like to be informed about ANC matters and the priorities I should focus on.

Some near-term priorities include:
- a unified communication plan for 5C07
- creating a lot of trackers, including:
  - a map of local development
  - a map of Traffic Safety Investigations and other service tickets
  - a staff-informed tracker of facilities issues at Langdon Elementary
  - a community calendar with local events
- writing a lot of issue pages for active development cases
- continuing to hone my understanding and lend my ideas/effort for issues DC-wide
