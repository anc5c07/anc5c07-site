{: .notice--success}

## tl;dr
- **joint** ([5B06](https://anc5b06.com) and 5C07) **SMD meeting**.
- The most important matter on the agenda will be the zoning case for [2001 Rhode Island Ave NE](/issues/2001ria/)
- The meeting will be entirely virtual

## Background
If these terms are confusing and/or you don't know if you live in 5B06 or 5C07, [visit the FAQ](/ancs/) or [the OpenANC map](https://openanc.org).
{: .notice--info}

**This is a joint meeting of SMDs 5B06 and 5C07** to be held on **3/27/2023** starting at 7pm. **The meeting will be all virtual** over Microsoft Teams.

Single-Member District meetings are:
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners
- per cultural norms, a precondition to bring official actions to 5B and 5C
- a chance for Commissioners to discuss issues with their immediate constituents
- not a venue for any official actions
- more common in some parts of DC than others

### Why are these joint meetings?
Commissioner Piekara and I do joint meetings because our community is split down the center by the Commission boundary along Rhode Island Ave, the epicenter of our community's housing production, retail/commercial activity, and street safety issues. Most obligatory ANC casework in our SMDs is shared by ANCs 5B and 5C with both being affected/party ANCs; having a joint meeting provides cross-pollinated awareness of both Commission's activities and avoids redundant meetings on the same topics.

**2001 RIA is an example of a case that concerns both Commissions;** both Commissions have automatic party status and both our reports would both have "Great Weight" because the address is directly on the boundary.

## Physical Location
There will be no physical location for March.

## Virtual Connection Details
The meeting will be available virtually on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).
