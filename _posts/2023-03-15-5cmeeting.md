## Costco Public Space Application
This concerns building a new curb cut into the Costco parking lot from Route 50 exit into Fort Lincoln, ostensibly to increase vehicle volume into and out of the parking lot. From the permit application:

> The purpose of this project is to relief traffic congestion at the existing Costco Wholesale. Due to TIA [(Traffic Impact Analysis)] results and discussions with Aaron Zimmerman [(of DDOT's [Development Review Program](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/development-review-program))], this project proposes on (1) new curb cut at the north east building corner to Fort Lincoln Drive NE. Additionally, this project proposes new traffic signage, traffic markings and striping, and new sidewalk connection along Fort Lincoln Drive to improve pedestrian functionality.

This plan is a near-term "fix" for vehicle gridlock getting into and out of the Costco parking lot. It was approved by DDOT after some adjustments. As far as I can tell, all design, substantiation of value/impact, and construction work is being conducted by contractors (Atlantic Traffic and Design) on behalf of Costco. The primary change is a new left-in/left-out driveway into the Costco parking lot. There is also a new sidewalk and crosswalk being installed as part of the work. There are additional options outlined in the traffic analysis for further long-term "improvement."
