## TL;DR
A gravel lot sits at the corner of 22nd and Jackson Sts. NE; right where the two streets hit Rhode Island Ave. NE. The church that owns the lot is seeking approvals for a mixed-use building on the site before selling it.

## Official Sources
This case will be heard by the Zoning Commission (ZC) and then, if approved, by the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA).

## Background
New Macedonia Baptist Church operated adjacent to the subject property, in the church building at 3200 22nd St. NE, and used the subject property as parking and an outdoor event space.

Both properties are being prepared for redevelopment. The church is no longer interested in occupying the building, and any kind of use would require substantial rehabilitation. The church has contracted with [Feldman Ruel](http://www.feldmanruel.com/) to have each property entitled for redevelopment and then sold. The proceeds will benefit the church, which is setting up new facilities closer to their congregants.

The church building itself, 3200 22nd St. NE, is planned to be residential only, but that is a separate case which will get its own post at some point.

## The Project
The gravel lot is planned to be mixed-use, with retail/restaurant spaces on the ground floor and residences on top. There will also be underground parking.

**Placeholder:** list the tentative planned number of units, square feet/character of retail, number of parking spaces, and any preliminary renderings publicly available

## The Issues
### ZC 21-14
The ZC case concerns changing the [Zoning Map](https://maps.dcoz.dc.gov/), which broadly determines what can be built where. If approved, the parcel would change from [**`R-1-B`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/residential/R-1-B/) ("predominantly developed with detached houses on moderately sized lots"), to [**`MU-4`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/mixed-use/MU-4/) ("moderate-density mixed-use development").

In this case, there is ample context to consider the switch, as the the parcel would move from matching the zone of the parcels directly north and west of it, to matching the parcels along Rhode Island Ave. NE to the northeast and southwest.

<p class="caption">2026 Jackson zoning in context, snapshotted from the official DC Zoning Map</p>

Considerations for whether ZC should make this change include harmony with the Comprehensive Plan (and [Future Land Use Map](https://planning.dc.gov/page/comprehensive-plan-future-land-use-maps)), community context, and infrastructure demands.

### future BZA case
Additional zoning relief might include specifics of the setbacks, courtyard size, or specific number of parking spaces, as examples. The considerations would be less drastic in nature, and be made with more specific building plans proposed.

## Community Action
Anyone can submit comments in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the ZC when judging the application. The easiest way is to send an email to **zcsubmissions@dc.gov** with the subject **"Letter in (Support/Opposition) for ZC 21-14"**. I'm happy to help regardless of your position, so feel free to reach out if you aren't sure what to write (or take a look at some letters of [support](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit31.pdf) and [opposition](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit37.pdf) in the case record).

This should be done by close-of-business the day before the next hearing, currently scheduled for **9/19/2022**

## In The Media
There was [a writeup about this project](https://www.hyattsvillewire.com/2022/04/21/evangel-missionary-baptist-church-condos/) on The Hyattsville Wire, where it was covered together with the adjacent project at 3200 22nd.
