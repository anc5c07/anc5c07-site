## tl;dr
- A vacant lot sits at the corner of **22nd and Jackson Sts. NE**; right where the two streets hit **Rhode Island Ave. NE**

- Latest designs are for **31 homes, 2,100 sq ft of retail, and 5 ground-floor structured parking spaces**
- The project **received a map amendment** in October 2022, and now has a **Board of Zoning Adjustment** case to be heard **5/3/2023**
- The case predominantly centers on **rear clearance from the neighboring building** by the same developer, 3200 22nd St. NE

## Background
The subject property is currently an empty gravel-covered lot owned by [The New Macedonia Baptist Church](http://www.tnmbc.org/). New Macedonia Baptist Church operated adjacent to it, in the church building at 3200 22nd St. NE, and used the vacant lot as parking and an outdoor event space. Both properties came to the church through mergers with other churches, and the church has now consolidated operations to a site in Southeast DC.

Both properties are being prepared for redevelopment. The church is no longer interested in occupying the building, and any kind of use would require substantial rehabilitation. The church has contracted with [Feldman Ruel](http://www.feldmanruel.com/) to have each property entitled for redevelopment and then sold. The proceeds will benefit the church, which will put it towards their continuing operations.

The church building itself, 3200 22nd St. NE, is planned to be residential only and has already received BZA approval as a separate case.

## The Project
The gravel lot is planned to be mixed-use, with retail/restaurant spaces on the ground floor and residences on top. There was originally planned to be underground parking, but the parking has since been moved under the second floor.

The current plans would include retail frontage buffered from the nearby detached houses on Jackson, along the corner abutting Rhode Island Ave. NE. It would include a possible sidewalk cafe within the footprint of the building (not in public space) along that corner. Parking garage access would be on 22nd St. NE, inbetween the retail and the planned homes in 3200 22nd.

<p class="caption">2026 Jackson rendering, from the south (BZA update)</p>

These plans have 31 homes, 2,100 square feet of retail, and 5 structured parking spaces. This makes it comparable to (but smaller than) 2027 Rhode Island Ave. NE (located on the other side of Rhode Island Ave. and just a little bit southwest). See the table for comparison.

|building|homes|sq. ft. retail|parking spaces|
|---|---|---|---|
|2026 Jackson St. NE|31|2,100|5|
|2027 Rhode Island Ave. NE|43|4,600|8|

## The Issues
### ZC 21-14
The ZC case concerned changing the [Zoning Map](https://maps.dcoz.dc.gov/), which broadly determines what can be built where. After approval, the parcel changed from [**`R-1-B`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/residential/R-1-B/) ("predominantly developed with detached houses on moderately sized lots"), to [**`MU-4`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/mixed-use/MU-4/) ("moderate-density mixed-use development").

In this case, there is ample context to consider the switch, as the parcel moved from matching the zone of the parcels directly north and west of it, to matching the parcels along Rhode Island Ave. NE to the northeast and southwest.

<p class="caption">2026 Jackson zoning in context, snapshotted from the official DC Zoning Map</p>

Considerations for whether ZC should make this change included harmony with the Comprehensive Plan (and [Future Land Use Map](https://planning.dc.gov/page/comprehensive-plan-future-land-use-maps)), community context, and infrastructure demands.

The map amendment carries an [**`IZ+`**](https://planning.dc.gov/inclusionaryzoning) stipulation, which raises the minimum affordable housing requirement slightly (likely to around 6 income-restricted units in the current plans).

### BZA 20872
During the ZC hearing, the issues of parking, trash collection, and aesthetics were both mentioned as issues to be discussed during the BZA hearing, which Chair Hood referred to as "another bite at the apple." There was some concern mentioned that the applicant could pursue a by-right development after receiving the map amendment; the applicants insisted this would be very difficult given the shape, size, and cost of the plot. Now that BZA 20872 is open, these will likely be discussed again.

The BZA case requests relief from two provisions, both centering on lot coverage to the rear to make up for building restriction lines on the Jackson and 22nd St frontage:
- **reduction of the 15-foot rear yard requirement** for the MU-4 zone
- **reduction in the 40-foot window clearance**; the building's plans contain rear-facing windows less than 40 feet from the adjacent building at 3200 22nd St. NE

## Community Action
[Anyone can submit comments](https://dcoz.dc.gov/node/1211256) in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the BZA when judging the application. Commissioner Piekara or I would be happy to help regardless of your position, so feel free to reach out if you aren't sure what to write (or take a look at some letters of [support](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit31.pdf) and [opposition](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit37.pdf) in the ZC case record, until there are some examples in the BZA record). You may also choose to speak at the hearing, but you will have to submit written comments either way.

### Submitting a Letter
To submit a letter:
- send before 4pm **Tuesday 5/2/2023** to be sure it's received in time
- email it to **bzasubmissions@dc.gov**
- include the case number (`BZA 20872`) and address (`2026 Jackson St. NE`) in the subject
- including some information about your proximity to the site, or residency within 5B06 if applicable, may help strengthen the weighing of your comments
