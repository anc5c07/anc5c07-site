## tl;dr
- **Many important traffic safety decisions are dictated in large part by a "warrant analysis"** in which a block or intersection is evaluated against certain criteria ("warrants") to preliminarily determine "need" for a certain mitigation
- **All-way stop installation and traffic light installation are two important examples** of studies that start with a warrant analysis
- **DDOT frequently prepares these for our neighborhood roadways, but will not share them**; in addition to making an investment and not sharing those results with the community, including folks like myself elected to represent it, they further spend money on shielding them from release

## Warrant Analysis

## Why Fight for Release?
Simply put, one of the primary questions from neighbors with even a passing interest in traffic safety is why certain traffic controls cannot be put in place at intersections with frequent near-misses. Many of us are accustomed to requesting and complaining, and our best case scenario (next to success) is being told it was looked into and not recommended/warranted.

See, for instance, Facebook threads (like [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brookand/posts/10160277843224121/) and [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brookand/posts/10160305784919121/)) on the need for all-way stop control at 13th and Newton Sts NE (requires being in the subject neighborhood Facebook Group).

## Anatomy of Documents
I recently conducted a blitz of FOIA requests concerning my request for at full traffic signal at [Rhode Island Ave NE and Thayer St NE](/issues/ria-thayer/). Documents are below.

I've chosen not to redact my personal information on these since it's very much in the public record anyway, but if other folks want to contribute docs, we can be sure to fully redact.
