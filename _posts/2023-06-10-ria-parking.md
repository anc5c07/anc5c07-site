This community concern runs along the boundary of 5C07, as well as through many other SMDs in 5B, 5C, and 5F

## tl;dr
- **Rhode Island Ave NE generally has off-peak street parking along the curbside lane**, and this has been the case for decades.
- **Off-peak parking (informally also called rush-hour parking restrictions)** is the condition of street parking being allowed most of the time, but not during peak roadway volume (generally 7:30am-9am inbound or 4-6:30pm outbound, Monday through Friday).
- **This condition creates [a number of problems](#the-problem-with-off-peak-parking), prevents [any adaptive reuse of the curbside lane](the-benefits-of-a-247-parking-lane)** in small portions, and has **major implications for future [bus lanes](http://localhost:4000/issues/ria-parking/#future-bus-lanes)**.
- **Some of Rhode Island Ave NE has been reprogrammed to 24/7 parking**, in other words ending rush-hour parking restrictions; [I have a plan to expand this condition](#advocating-for-change) to more of Rhode Island Ave NE.

## Interplay with Future Roadway Uses
There is some legitimate concern that introducing 24/7 parking will create a new expectation for drivers that will only have to be unlearned in the future to introduce dedicated bus/bike lanes along Rhode Island Ave.

### future bus lanes
My top priority for quick-build adaptive reuse of Rhode Island Ave's excess crosswidth would be implementing dedicated bus lanes. The least contentious bus lane implementation would make use of the extra lane available because of off-peak parking, by creating a peak-traffic (rush-hour) curbside bus lane. This is currently the most common implementation of bus priority lanes in DC.

However, having discussed this with DDOT's Bus Priority team on several occasions, it will be many years before any such lanes are considered for Rhode Island Ave west of North Capitol St. The bus frequency and ridership does not meet DDOT's criteria for prioritization. Current RIA buses having to merge left and pull into the Rhode Island Row development are another hindrance to the utility of lanes there. As a result, I've reluctantly concluded to pursue 24/7 parking over near-term bus priority lanes, to address the active problems in a readily available way.

The good news is that beginning the adaptive reuse of Rhode Island Ave's curbside lane now will help us later push for a recommendation for 24/7 offset bus lanes, rather than peak curbside lanes.

Much of Georgia Ave followed this progression:
- **sometime in the mid '00s:** 24/7 parking was implemented, where off-peak parking had been the prevailing condition
- **2011:** curb extensions into the curbside lane were implemented for many intersections
- **present-day:** DDOT has recommended 24/7 offset bus lanes, [currently undergoing design work for implementation](https://buspriority.ddot.dc.gov/pages/03426fcc0a3b4abf8f1c8a47a989ec38)

There are many benefits to offset bus lanes:
- **bus priority will be in place 24/7** rather than only during rush-hour
- **driver noncompliance will be somewhat mitigated** as the curbside lane remains available for parking and drivers will now only be passing through the bus lane on the way to parking or right-turn pocket lanes
- **less crosswidth needs to be dedicated to the bus lane** as offset lanes [can be slighly narrower](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/transit-streets/dedicated-curbside-offset-bus-lanes/#:~:text=The%20minimum%20width%20of%20a%20curbside%20bus%20lane%20is%2011%20feet.) while serving their purpose (10' minimum of width rather than 11')
- **general-use lanes are further reduced** in the case of Georgia and Rhode Island Aves, which are each generally three lanes in each direction (plus occasional left-turn pocket lanes), roadway use can be tightly programmed accordingly:
  - curbside lane with right-turn pocket lanes, 24/7 parking and pickup/dropoff zones, and other non-vehicle uses
  - middle lane for offset bus lanes
  - interior lane for general use
  - occasional left-turn pocket lanes

Not only will implementing 24/7 parking today not conflict with offset bus lanes in the future, but they're essentially a precondition; it's hard to imagine implementing curbside bus lanes directly from the current condition of three general-use lanes during peak volume, as this would be an instantaneous reduction of general-us lanes at peak use from three lanes to one.

## Advocating for Change
I've discussed implementing 24/7 parking with DDOT's Curbside Management Division, and we devised a roadmap for the community, affected ANCs, RIA Main Street, and/or business owners to come together and seek this change for some additional portion of Rhode Island Ave. I plan to work with all of the above stakeholders to make the case and submit a comprehensive request to DDOT.

This would involve drafting a request as a letter and/or ANC resolutions, and seeking endorsement from as many of the following as possible:
- DC Squared (the organization that administers RIA Main Street)
- ANCs 5B and 5C (and possibly 5F depending on scope)
- Councilmember Parker as the Ward 5 Councilmember, and/or CM McDuffie as Chairperson of the Council Committee on Business and Economic Development
- as many business owners and residents of the corridor as might want to sign on

and submitting it to DDOT Curbside Management Division.

### scoping
In discussions with CMD, I was advised to be moderately ambitious on scope. Some possible scoping for the ask would be implementing 24/7 parking on:
- **the outbound side of Rhode Island Ave NE from 20th St NE to 24th St NE** (the other side of the street from where this has been the case for nearly a decade)
- **in both directions for the entirety of the MU-4 zone** from 13th St NE to 24th St NE
- **in both directions for the entirety of the Rhode Island Ave Main Street operating area**, from 4th St NE to Eastern Ave NE

The letter/resolutions may include 2-3 tiers of ask.
