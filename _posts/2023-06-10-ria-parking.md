## tl;dr
- **Rhode Island Ave NE generally has off-peak street parking along the curbside lane**, and this has been the case for decades
- **Off-peak parking (informally also called rush-hour parking restrictions)** is the condition of street parking being allowed most of the time, but not during peak roadeway use (generally 7:30am-9am inbound or 4-6:30pm outbound, Monday through Friday)
- **This condition creates a number of problems** related to enforcement priority, induced roadway volume, aggressive right-passing, pedestrian safety, and business needs related to driving patrons
- **This condition also prevents any adaptive reuse of the curbside lane in small portions** such as with curb extensions for pedestrian safety at crossings, bus stop islands, sidewalk extensions to preserve access around heritage trees, on-street installations such as bikeshare docks, and public space permitting for streeteries and other temporary or permanent amenities
- **It is possible to reprogram the curbside to 24/7 parking**, in other words end rush-hour parking restrictions; this was done for the in-bound blocks from 20th St NE to 24th St NE around the time Zeke's Coffee opened
- **I've discussed implementing 24/7 parking with DDOT's Curbside Management Division** and we devised a roadmap for the community, ANCs 5B and 5C (and possibly 5F), RIA Main Street, and/or business owners to come together and seek this change for some additional portion of Rhode Island Ave
- **I plan to work with all of the above stakeholders to make the case** and submit the request to DDOT
