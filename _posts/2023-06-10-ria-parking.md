## tl;dr
- **Rhode Island Ave NE generally has off-peak street parking along the curbside lane**, and this has been the case for decades
- **Off-peak parking (informally also called rush-hour parking restrictions)** is the condition of street parking being allowed most of the time, but not during peak roadway volume (generally 7:30am-9am inbound or 4-6:30pm outbound, Monday through Friday)
- **This condition creates [a number of problems](#the-problem-with-off-peak-parking)** related to enforcement priority, induced roadway volume, aggressive right-passing, pedestrian safety, and business needs
- **This condition also prevents [any adaptive reuse of the curbside lane](the-benefits-of-a-247-parking-lane) in small portions** such as with curb extensions for pedestrian safety at crossings, bus stop islands, sidewalk extensions to preserve access around heritage trees, on-street installations such as bikeshare docks, and public space permitting for streeteries and other temporary or permanent amenities
- **While there could be [concerns about creating a new parking entitlement](#interplay-with-future-roadway-uses)** and how that could influence future roadway changes, I believe given all circumstances that embracing 24/7 could improve our future prospects, such as for [bus lanes](http://localhost:4000/issues/ria-parking/#future-bus-lanes)
- **Some of Rhode Island Ave NE has been reprogrammed to 24/7 parking**, in other words ending rush-hour parking restrictions; [I have a plan and intend to expand this condition](#advocating-for-change) to more of Rhode Island Ave NE.

## Interplay with Future Roadway Uses
There is some legitimate concern that introducing 24/7 parking will create a new expectation for drivers that will only have to be unlearned in the future to introduce dedicated bus/bike lanes along Rhode Island Ave.

### future bus lanes
My top priority for reuse of the Rhode Island Ave's excess crosswidth would be implementing dedicated bus lanes. A quick bus lane implementation would make use of the extra lane available because of off-peak parking by creating an off-peak bus lane out of the curbside lane. This is the bus priority recommendation implemented in most places within DC where bus priority lanes have been implemented.

However, in the current timeline for bus priority projects, it will be many years before any such lanes are studied for Rhode Island Ave west of North Capitol St, while the pressing reasons for implementing 24/7 parking, and prospect for implementing it quickly, exist today. Additionally, beginning the adaptive reuse of Rhode Island Ave's curbside lane now will help us later push for a recommendation for 24/7 offset bus lanes, rather than peak curbside lanes.

Much of Georgia Ave followed this progression:
- **sometime in the mid '00s:** 24/7 parking was implemented, where off-peak parking had been the prevailing condition
- **2011:** curb extensions into the curbside lane were implemented for many intersections
- **present-day:** DDOT has recommended 24/7 offset bus lanes, and they are currently undergoing design work for implementation

There are many benefits to offset bus lanes:
- **bus priority will be in place 24/7** rather than only during rush-hour
- **driver noncompliance will be somewhat mitigated** as the curbside lane remains available for parking and drivers will now only be passing through the bus lane on the way to parking or right-turn pocket lanes
- **less crosswidth needs to be dedicated to the bus lane** as offset lanes [can be slighly narrower](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/transit-streets/dedicated-curbside-offset-bus-lanes/#:~:text=The%20minimum%20width%20of%20a%20curbside%20bus%20lane%20is%2011%20feet.) while serving their purpose (10' minimum of width rather than 11')
- **general-use lanes are further reduced** in the case of Georgia and Rhode Island Aves, which are each generally three lanes in each direction (plus occasional left-turn pocket lanes), roadway use can be tightly programmed accordingly:
  - curbside lane with right-turn pocket lanes, 24/7 parking and pickup/dropoff zones, and other non-vehicle uses
  - middle lane for offset bus lanes
  - interior lane for general use
  - occasional left-turn pocket lanes

Not only will implementing 24/7 parking today not conflict with offset bus lanes in the future, but they're essentially a precondition; it's hard to imagine implementing curbside bus lanes direction from the current condition of three general-use lanes during peak volume, as this would be an instantaneous reduction of general-us lanes at peak use from three lanes to one.

## Advocating for Change
I've discussed implementing 24/7 parking with DDOT's Curbside Management Division, and we devised a roadmap for the community, affected ANCs, RIA Main Street, and/or business owners to come together and seek this change for some additional portion of Rhode Island Ave. I plan to work with all of the above stakeholders to make the case and submit a comprehensive request to DDOT.

This would involve drafting a request as a letter, and seeking:
- Endorsement from ANCs 5B and 5C (and possibly 5F depending on scope)
- Endorsement by DC Squared (the organization the administers RIA Main Street)
- Additional sign-on from business owners and residents of the corridor

and submitting it to DDOT Curbside Management Division.

In discussions with CMD, I was advised to be moderately ambitious on scope. Some possible scoping for the ask:
- implement 24/7 parking on the outbound side of Rhode Island Ave NE from 20th St NE to 24th St NE (the other side of the street from where this has been the case for nearly a decade)
- implement 24/7 parking in both directions for the entirety of the MU-4 zone from 13th St NE to 24th St NE
- implement 24/7 parking for the entirety of the Rhode Island Ave Main Street operating area, from 4th St NE to Eastern Ave NE

The letter may include 2-3 tiers of ask.
