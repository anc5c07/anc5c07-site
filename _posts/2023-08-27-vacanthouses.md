## tl;dr
- Our neighborhood remains full of areas where the only capacity to build is single-family homes
- Many homes have reached end-of-life and require, at minimum, a full replacement of the pipes, wires, and walls
- Without the capacity to build additional homes, the likely action is rebuilding as larger single-family homes
- We have a few (maybe insufficient) methods to mitigate this lower market return and push owners/developers towards delivering occupiable homes
- Awareness and scrutiny are key to employing those methods

## Vacant/Blighted Property Tax
[DC OTR charges a different property tax rate](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/page/real-property-tax-rates) depending on property use and [condition categories determined by DC DOB](https://dob.dc.gov/page/vacant-buildings). Here are the current property tax rates that would apply to a single-family home:

|type|rate|description|
|---|---|---|
|[Homestead/Senior/ Disabled/Veteran](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/page/homesteadsenior-citizen-deduction)|0% on first $84k, $445k, or half of assessed value|This is property tax relief available to DC residents who occupy the subject property as their primary residence; see the link for more details|
|Standard/Active/"Class 1"|.85%|This is the standard DC residential property tax rate (and would apply to the remaining value in the relief case above)|
|Vacant/"Class 3"|5%|This is a property that is not occupied and not actively being prepared or offered for use|
|Blighted/"Class 4"|10%|This is a property that is not only vacant, but an active safety/health hazard|

## Inventory of these cases
If you're aware of any vacant houses not cataloged here, please let me know. If you believe one of these is now occupied, please let me know so I can remove it. This isn't meant for areas that are eligible for mixed-use/multifamily construction; see the [Development Tracker](/development/) for those.
