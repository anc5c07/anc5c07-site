## tl;dr
- [**Green Valley Apartments**](https://abcmgt.orleanco.com/locations/green-valley-apartments/) is an affordable senior living facility located at **2412 Franklin St NE**
- **The building is zoning nonconforming;** as best as I can tell, this isn't due to a change of zoning for this parcel, but due to a change in allowances (or typical variances) for the R-1-B zone since its construction in 1971
- **Any change in the floor area of a nonconforming building requires zoning relief;** in this case, they're seeking to add a new elevator enclosure and entry vestibule to accomodate modern wheelchairs and stretchers; there are a few additional [pieces of zoning relief](#needed-zoning-relief) related to the elevator containment height and shape
- **ANC 5C issued a report recommending approval** at the 6/21 Full-Commission Meeting
- [**You can submit a letter**](#community-action) into the record for this zoning case
- **You can also help me distribute [flyers](/flyers/)** to residents in and around the building so they're aware of the plans and their opportunities to voice support (or opposition)

## Case Record
This case will be heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA).

|agency|case|summary|next hearing|ANC status|case status|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|[BZA](https://dcoz.dc.gov/bza/about)|[20948](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=20948)|[Four elements](#needed-zoning-relief) related to the minimal retrofit of a nonconforming building|10/25/2023|**6/21/2023:** recommended approval 6-0|no action yet|

Some particularly interesting artifacts include:
- **[Proposed Plans](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=309658):** this document contains renderings and elevations for the proposed modifications
- **[Applicant Statement of Support](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=309702):** this states the comprehensive case for this relief application, written on behalf of the applicant by land-use attorneys

## Plans
The proposed construction involves:
- **renovating the existing 100 low-income senior homes**, without a change in qualifications to live there, number of homes, or expected occupancy of homes; the homes will be renovated in phases to allow for continuous occupation by tenants
- **various interior upgrades** to the building infrastructure and common areas, such as the plumbing, electrical, and heating systems
- **expanding the entry vestibule** to allow for ADA-compliant mailboxes and easier wheelchair access into the building
- **adding a third elevator enclosure to the external building on the north (rear) side** to accomodate modern emergency needs such as stretchers; this enclosure will rise up to slightly higher than the predominant building height of 44 feet (which is four feet higher than current zoning allowances for this site) and join with the existing elevator enclosure (while not rising up nearly as high)


### Needed Zoning Relief
All of this creates four components of necessary relief:
- **Area Variance: The non-conforming use requirements** of `Subtitle C ยง 204.1`: the new elevator enclosure and expanded vestibule will (marginally) increase gross floor area of the nonconforming building; any increase in gross floor area of a nonconforming building requires this type of variance.
- **Area Variance: The height requirements** of `Subtitle D ยง 303.1`: the new elevator enclosure will rise higher than the 40 feet currently allowed, due to a need to service the fourth floor of the existing 44-foot building.
- **Special Exception: The penthouse setback requirements** of `Subtitle C ยง 1504.1`: the new elevator enclosure, in rising slightly higher than the general 44-foot height of the building, makes use of penthouse allowances, but does not conform to setback requirements (the need to rise further back than the exterior of the building to reduce the visual height from ground view) as it is being added to the exterior of the existing building.
- **Special Exception: The penthouse enclosing wall requirements** of `Subtitle C ยง 1503.4`: the new elevator enclosure, in not rising as high as the existing penthouse elevator enclosure, creates a non-uniform penthouse height, which in turn creates another needed exception.

## History
The Green Valley Apartments were built in 1971 by the adjacent Second New Saint Paul Baptist Church, which owns the building and has operated in the adjacent sanctuary building since 1957. You can learn about the vision the lead to the building's construction [on the church's website](http://snspbc.org/announcement/green-valley-senior-citizen-apartments-1969-1971).

### Previous Zoning Cases
There are a number of prior zoning cases related to this property. Here are some I've found:

|1993|[15845](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=15845)|Summary judgement related to lot coverage of a nonconforming lot; unclear if impacts the apartment building or only the adjacent church|
