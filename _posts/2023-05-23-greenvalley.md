I have not yet filled this out with details from [BZA case 20948](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=20948) but they are publicly available
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- [**Green Valley Apartments**](https://abcmgt.orleanco.com/locations/green-valley-apartments/) is an affordable senior living facility located at **2412 Franklin St NE**
- **The building is zoning nonconforming;** I believe due to a [1990 map amendment](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=90-16) that removed commercial zoning in this area (more research needed)
- **Any change in the building footprint of a nonconforming building requires zoning relief;** in this case, they're seeking to increase the size of the elevator containment and entry vestibule to accomodate modern wheelchairs and stretchers, among other considerations

## Outreach History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact methods on the footer of this webpage.
