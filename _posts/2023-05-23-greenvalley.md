I have not yet filled this out with details from [BZA case 20948](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=20948) but they are publicly available
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- [**Green Valley Apartments**](https://abcmgt.orleanco.com/locations/green-valley-apartments/) is an affordable senior living facility located at **2412 Franklin St NE**
- **The building is zoning nonconforming;** As best as I can tell, this isn't due to a change of zoning for this parcel (which was subdivided as part of the proposal to build this building), but due to a change in allowances for the R-1-B zone.
- **Any change in the building footprint of a nonconforming building requires zoning relief;** in this case, they're seeking to increase the size of the elevator containment and entry vestibule to accomodate modern wheelchairs and stretchers, among other considerations
- **A few additional pieces of zoning relief** all relate to design considerations for a retrofit that minimally disturbs the existing structure, layout, and number of homes

## Case Record
This case has been heard by the Zoning Commission, and will subsequently be heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA).

Some particularly interesting artifacts include:
- **[Applicant Statement of Support](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=309702):** this states the comprehensive case for this relief application, written on behalf of the applicant by land-use attorneys


## Plans
The proposed construction involves:
- **renovating the existing 100 low-income senior homes**, without a change in qualifications to live there, number of homes, or expected occupancy of homes
- **adding a third elevator enclosure to the external building on the south side** to accomodate modern emergency needs such as stretchers; this enclosure will rise up to slightly higher than the predominant building height of 44 feet (which is four feet higher than current zoning allowances for this site) and join with the existing elevator enclosure (while not rising up nearly as high)
- **expanding the entry vestibule** to allow for ADA-compliant mailboxes and easier wheelchair access into the building

### Needed Zoning Relief
All of this creates four components of necessary relief:
- **Area Variance: The non-conforming use requirements** of `Subtitle C § 204.1`: the new elevator enclosure and expanded vestibule will (marginally) increase gross floor area of the nonconforming building; any increase in gross floor area of nonconforming building requires this type of variance.
- **Area Variance: The height requirements** of `Subtitle D § 303.1`: the new elevator enclosure will rise higher than the 40 feet currently allowed, due to a need to service the fourth floor of the existing 44-foot building.
- **Special Exception: The penthouse setback requirements** of `Subtitle C § 1504.1`: the new elevator enclosure, in rising slightly higher than the general 44-foot height of the building, makes use of penthouse allowances, but does not conform to setback requirements (the need to rise further back than the exterior of the building to reduce the visual height from ground view) as it is being added to the exterior of the existing building.
- **Special Exception: The penthouse enclosing wall requirements** of `Subtitle C § 1503.4`: the new elevator enclosure, in not rising as high as the existing penthouse elevator enclosure, creates a non-uniform penthouse height, which in turn creates another needed exception.

## Previous Zoning Cases
There are a number of prior zoning cases related to this property. Here are some I've found:

|year|case|summary|
|---|---|---|
|1970-71|[10472](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=10472)|Subdivision of the building lot and the church lot to allow construction of this building|

|1993|[15845](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=15845)|Summary judgement related to lot coverage of a nonconforming lot; unclear if impacts the apartment building or only the adjacent church|

## Outreach History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact methods on the footer of this webpage.
