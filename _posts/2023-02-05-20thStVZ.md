## tl;dr
- **20th St NE** is a road in the center of our neighborhood, that bisects Langdon Park along a particularly dangerous sloped stretch
- **The street carries a lot of pedestrian traffic, particularly children** due to proximity to the park amenities, Woodridge Library, and both Langdon and John Burroughs Elementary Schools
- **Neighbors have been advocating for speed mitigations** here for many years, but there have not been any significant changes
- **In February 2023, Andy Carino crashed their car** at high speed after collecting speed on this stretch, and died from their injuries
- **After a traffic fatality, DDOT conducts a [Vision Zero](https://visionzero.dc.gov/) investigation** into possible mitigations that can be implemented immediately, to prevent recurrence of such a tragedy. This investigation is ongoing.
- **[Many likely and theoretical mitigations](/issues/20thst/#discussed-mitigations)** were discussed at a February 15th site visit.

## Roadway Characteristics
20th St NE in this area is 32 feet wide, with no center-line markings except immediately adjacent to intersections. There is parking available on both sides, and travel runs in one lane in each direction, making four theoretically four 8-foot wide lanes.

## February 2023 crash

Andy Carino crashed their car around 11:40pm on Friday, 2/3/2023; impact with parked cars occurred on the 3000 blk of 20th St NE after accelerating through the 2800 and 2900 blocks of 20th St NE. MPD Press release [here](https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/traffic-fatality-3000-block-20th-street-northeast). Some media from the neighborhood shared on social media [here](https://twitter.com/VJKapur/status/1622626769495883781).

## Vision Zero response
A Vision Zero investigation follows a similar protocol to ddot's [Traffic Safety Input/Investigation](https://ddot.dc.gov/service/traffic-safety-input) process, in terms of what mitigations and factors would be considered, but it has its own prioritization outside of the standard priority scoring/queuing.

### Feb 15th site visit
This is meant to be a memorandum of a meeting, so I'm switching to third-person/formal titles

#### Discussed mitigations
There were many ideas thrown out during the walk, which covered the subject area of 20th St north of the mid-block crossing, as well as the block of Hamlin immediately west of 20th (by Woodridge Library).

##### Mid-block crossing
Many mitigations and concerns were shared about the wide crosswalk that connects both sides of Langdon Park across 20th St. This crosswalk is at the nadir of two downwards slopes on either side, which makes it particularly dangerous as drivers tend to lose track of the speed they're going downhill. This also makes it a common place to attempt unsafe speeds, especially after the roadway as repaved in October 2021. We saw some commonplace speeding occur in the crosswalk as the meeting started.

The crosswalk was recently moved south slightly to avoid conflict with curbside catch basins and allow for accessibility ramps on both sides, which were installed concurrent with a cycle of sidewalk maintenance work days after Carino's crash.
- **raised crosswalk:** Ms. Bailey shared that DDOT does plan to raise this crosswalk. Ms. Dirirsa shared some specifics of what it may look like, with the width of the crosswalk possibly shrinking a bit to around 10 feet. Ms. Bailey noted that the new accessibility ramps would be integrated into the design. Concerns were expressed about the height of the raised crosswalk, citing the shallow crosswalk on Varnum St NE; Ms. Dirirsa noted she's working on mitigations to improve that crosswalk now, and we can rework a new one on 20th as needed.
- **flashing pedestrian signage:** Ms. Bailey also shared that some consideration is being given to adding light-up pedestrian signage to the crossing, though this was not sure to occur at this point.
Horizontal mitigations: Ms. Clausen asked about adding a "choke point" to the crosswalk. Many folks concurred that horizontal mitigation around the crosswalk would both further slow drivers down as they passed through the area bisecting the park, as well as park the crosswalk from being parked near and over, which occurs very commonly. DDOT personnel stated consideration would be given to installing flexposts around the crosswalk to this end. In further conversations, Ms. Dirirsa noted that drainage would complicate hardened curb extensions in this area.
- **continuous sidewalk:** Commissioner Kapur asked if any consideration was given to making the crossing a continuous sidewalk, but Ms. Bailey and Mr. Baker stated this was not in DDOT's toolkit at this time. While provisions related to this were recently passed by the Council and are in the DC Code, they are not yet available at this time.
- **grade separation/overpass:** Ms. Westover raised the possibility of grade-separating pedestrians and vehicles in this area of 20th with a pedestrian bridge or vehicle overpass, to allow free traversal across the whole of Langdon Park without a conflict zone. Commissioner Kapur remarked that it would be a policy failure for us to not create safer vehicle operation here so that wasn't necessary.
- **park connecting/street closure:** Commissioner Kapur also remarked that if making 20th St in this area safe was impossible, perhaps a true safety-focused course of action would be to expand the park through what's currently 20th St, and allow the street to dead-end on both sides. Former Commissioner Odunsi strongly disagreed with this idea, citing the need for drivers to use 20th St, and the responsibility of parents to protect their children from drivers. Commissioner Kapur stated that any adaptation could occur to accommodate safety, and noted we would all like to live in a city where we do not need to grip our children's hands that tightly.

##### 2800-2900 blk of Hamlin
This is the block surrounding the mid-block crossing, and is steeply downhill towards the mid-block crossing on both sides. Carino collected speed throughout this area of roadway, upshifting multiple times.
- **vertical mitigations:** DDOT expressed that mitigations along the sloped sections is not permitted under their guidelines due to the grade of the slope. Ms. Dirirsa stated that the threshold for this is eight degrees slope.
- **horizontal mitigations:** There had been some discussion among residents before the meeting about reducing the width of the roadway and adding horizontal mitigations to reduce how straight it is, using [chicanes](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/saferjourney1/Library/countermeasures/26.htm#:~:text=26.,that%20motorists%20can%20maintain%20speeds.), though there may not be an implementations in DC. There was some brief discussion about using bike corrals (of which there is one already on 20th just north of Hamlin) to create these fixed horizontal movements.

##### 20th/Hamlin
Andy Carino drove straight through the four-way stop at this intersection, with some back-of-the-envelope calculations using video timestamps and intersection width putting their speed at 87-109 mph. Residents remarked on poor stop sign compliance at this intersection generally, and we stopped to observe a lot of driver behavior in all directions.
- **stop sign camera:** DDOT plans to explore installing a stop sign camera, but Ms. Bailey was not sure it was likely to end up in the priority list of intersections for it.
- **daylighting:** DDOT plans to explore expanding the no parking zone and possibly installing a stop sign camera
- **physical daylighting:** residents noted the importance of physical barriers to enforce any no parking zone, as compliance seems unlikely
- **vertical mitigation:** the idea of raising the crosswalk or other vertical mitigation was mentioned; Ms. Bailey noted DDOT does not currently consider this to be in its toolkit at this time.

##### 1800-1900 blk Hamlin
As we observed at 20th/Hamlin, the discussion turned to driver behavior through this intersection when coming from the west. Drivers make a less-than-90-degree turn coming off Rhode Island Ave right in front of the library, and usually proceed at high speed through this intersection, likely attempting a shortcut through the neighborhood between Rhode Island Ave and South Dakota Ave
- **fortifying existing speedhumps:** Two speedhumps on this block were installed in February 2021. However, residents remarked on how shallow they are, so they're insufficient to slow down drivers. DDOT expressed that improving those speedhumps might be possible.
- **library crosswalk:** There was discussion about driver behavior surrounding the crosswalk directly in front of Woodridge Library. In addition to taking the turn at high speeds, drivers frequently park in the middle of the library crosswalk while stopping by the library, a condition we readily observed during the walk. Commissioner Kapur pointed out in the parallel area north of Rhode Island Ave, a small sidewalk extension exists into the crosswalk to make this more difficult. Mr. Baker remarked that perhaps flexposts could be used to create similar in front of the library.
- **vestigal connector closure:** In addition to being a less-than-90-degree turn, the intersection of Hamlin St, Rhode Island Ave, and Queens Chapel Rd here creates vestigial connectors that operate like a slip lane to allow faster turns. Commissioner Kapur remarked that he had put in a TSI request ([SR 22-00414831](https://twitter.com/VJKapur/status/1569344363167383553)) seeking to close the portion of Hamlin directly in front of the library entirely, as it had been the case for months during library construction; this would create a large pedestrian area in front of the library, and allow a portion of Queens Chapel to serve as two-way traffic with more rigid 90-degree turns on and off the arterial. DDOT did not seem particularly receptive to the idea.

##### 20th/Franklin
20th and Franklin is where Carino crash movement began, as they accelerated from a stop through this intersection going north. While we didn't visit the intersection on the walk, there was some discussion about mitigations that could occur there.
- **horizontal mitigations:** There are already turn-hardening and centerline-hardening flexposts at 17th/Franklin and 18th/Franklin. Commissioner Kapur remarked to Ms. Dirirsa that any addition of these to 20th/Franklin, where there are none, could be helpful.
