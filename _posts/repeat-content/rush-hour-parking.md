## The Problem with Off-Peak Parking
Off-peak parking is the condition of allowing street parking only outside of weekday rush-hour. These may also be called rush-hour parking restrictions. In DC, this generally means:
- parking on the outbound side is disallowed from 4pm to 6:30pm Monday through Friday
- parking on the inbound side of the roadway is disallowed from 7:30am to 9am Monday through Friday

This condition theoretically allows for through traffic to make use of an extra lane during peak usage times. Traffic modeling software would appear to weigh this factor when considering the congestion of a roadway given expected traffic volumes.

However, I believe there are a number of problems with this.

### Induced Volume
It is accepted that introducing roadway volume induces roadway use, a phenomenon known as [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand).

### Limited Utility
I would contend that additional volume capacity induced by the off-peak parking lane at rush hour is limited in utility to only the most aggressive drivers who are willing to repeatedly pass on the right and merge back into traffic. This is because the curbside lane is rarely clear of obstruction due to:
- noncompliant parking
- noncompliant pickup/dropoff
- stopped buses
- drivers yielding before turning right

### Traffic Safety Concerns
As a result of being used for aggressive right-passing, and because there is no longer a parking lane available curbside as a buffer between the sidewalk and general use lanes, the sidewalk along an off-peak parking lane during rush-hour can be an extremely unpleasant environment for pedestrians, who must watch drivers veer towards them without a buffer at high speeds as they come into the curbside lane for intermittent use.

This further erodes the business environment and general hospitability of our neighborhood for hours a day, for the benefit of through drivers who neither live nor are conducting business in our neighborhood.

### Enforcement Issues
The enforcement of rush-hour no parking zones is generally a high priority for the DC Department of Public Works (DPW) which handles parking enforcement. In general, vehicles parked in these lanes during restricted times will quickly receive a high fine with immediate tow request. There at least two problems with this:
- an extremely high burden to drivers parking on the arterial who miss the deadline to move their cars, which in turn is a heavy deterrence to stopping in our neighborhoods
- an unfortunate allocation of limited parking enforcement resources that might be dedicated to critical safety needs elsewhere in our neighborhoods

### Hindering Business Patronage and Operations
Issues with rush-hour parking along Rhode Island Ave are always a top-of-mind issue for businesses along Rhode Island Ave. At a time when there are many potential customers driving through the neighborhood, their capacity to stop and patronize local businesses is limited by the rush-hour parking restrictions.

A desire to allow stop-in driving patrons at Zeke's Coffee in 2014 was a large factor in ending the rush-hour restrictions on the 2000-2100 and 2200-2300 blocks of Rhode Island Ave inbound. This concern continues to affect other businesses where the restrictions remain in place. It's also detrimental for the same reasons to the businesses on the inbound side, as outbound drivers may also likely park and cross the street to patronize these businesses in the evenings.

Meanwhile, the inhospitable pedestrian environment reduces foot traffic and also deprives businesses of this patronage during the times most folks are out of work and most likely to stop in for breakfast or dinner services.

Lastly, any curbside commercial loading or pick-up/dropoff is also generally suspended during rush-hour in these areas, taking away space businesses might use for deliveries or pick-up/dropoff patronage.

DDOT Curbside Management indicated to me that business concerns (and those of affected Business Improvement District (BID) organizations, which broadly would apply to DC Squared, the organization that administers the Rhode Island Ave Main Street and Bladensburg Road Main Street programs) would be a large consideration in ending any existing rush-hour parking restrictions.

## The Benefits of a 24/7 Parking Lane
A 24/7 parking lane, not hindered by the need to accomodate through traffic at any point in the day, can be augmented on the margins for other temporary or permanent uses, such as with curb extensions for pedestrian safety at crossings, bus stop islands, sidewalk extensions to preserve access around heritage trees, on-street installations such as bikeshare docks, and public space permitting for streeteries and other amenities.
