## Off-peak parking
Off-peak parking is the condition of allowing street parking only outside of weekday rush-hour. These may also be called rush-hour parking restrictions. In DC, this generally means:
- parking on the outbound side is disallowed from 4pm to 6:30pm Monday through Friday
- parking on the inbound side of the roadway is disallowed from 7:30am to 9am Monday through Friday

This condition theoretically allows for through-traffic to make use of an extra lane during peak usage times. Traffic modeling software would appear to weigh this factor when considering the congestion of a roadway given expected traffic volumes.
