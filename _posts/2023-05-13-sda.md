## tl;dr
- South Dakota Ave is a 3.6-mile arterial roadway
- Driver behavior on this roadway is extremely bad, with rampant speeding and red-light running among other problems
- Residents of the roadway are fighting for a safer road by design
- Dedicated funding in Fiscal Year 2024 could make it happen

## history
Part of moving forward it understanding how we got here.

South Dakota Avenue is entirely outside of the original City of Washington designed by Pierre L'Enfant, and has no origins in that plan. By 1898, it appears in the DC Permanent System of Highways master planning document, which implemented Congressional directives to extend the logic of L'Enfant's plan outward to the entire District of Columbia. Some more historical map artifacts on the piecemeal construction below.

|1898|The full length of SDA (minus link to NYA/50) appears in DC's Permanent System of Highways; a segment from Irving to Bladensburg appears to overlap with the ring road connecting Civil War forts|[LoC](https://www.loc.gov/item/88690813/)|
|1903|Named `Prospect Ave`, the only segment of what would become SDA exists between Vista and Brentwood Road (at a segment later becoming part of Rhode Island Ave).|[Baist/LoC](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3850.la002283/?r=0.506,0.457,0.09,0.051,0)|
|1933|Most of the modern-day roadway has been built, save for a planned portion north from Sargent to Riggs, and the hook into NYA and Route 50 to the south.|[RareMap](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/29483/Map_of_the_Permanent_System_of_Highways_District_of_Columbia_1933/Office%20of%20the%20Engineer%20Commissioner%20D.C..html)|
|1954|New York Avenue is extended from Bladensburg Road to US-50, presumably joining in South Dakota Ave.||
