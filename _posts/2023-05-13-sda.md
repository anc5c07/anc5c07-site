## tl;dr
- South Dakota Ave is a 3.6-mile arterial roadway
- Driver behavior on this roadway is extremely bad, with rampant speeding and red-light running among other problems
- Residents of the roadway, organized as [Friends of South Dakota Avenue NE](https://twitter.com/fosdaneDC) (FoSDANE) are fighting for a safer road by design
- Dedicated funding in Fiscal Year 2024 could begin the process of making these changes
- We [need to keep up pressure](#committee-of-the-whole-action) on Council Chair Mendelson to make sure the Transportation Committee allocation makes it into the final budget
- We [also need to provide feedback to WMATA](#better-bus-network-redesign) to advocate for two proposed brand-new SDA bus lines: currently dubbed DC214 and DC207

## FY24 Tactical Safety Funding
Since the beginning of the FY24 budget process, the issue of funding safety improvements to South Dakota Ave has been a high priority of mine, Councilmember Parker, and the Councilmember's team.

### early letters
In a February 3rd email to Councilmember Parker's team, I wrote in part:

> My other major ask is that dedicated funding be included for large-scale whole-corridor studies of our principal arterial roadways, including Rhode Island, South Dakota, and New York Aves. I believe the ongoing work on Bladensburg Rd, from Starburst Plaza all the way up to Eastern Ave, is a good example of the scale and scope such a project requires (especially should the final designs more closely align with Concept One). Meanwhile, the other three major arterials surrounding my SMD are in need of fundamental redesigns that prioritize those in our neighborhood over those only driving through it, and all have been the subject of studies that have not resulted in major implementation

I also mentioned the mobilization of efforts of South Dakota Ave residents that would become the Friends of South Dakota Ave NE:

> Residents of South Dakota Avenue have mobilized, forming an initiative for action that has grown in short time, and has residents from Riggs Park to Fort Lincoln, intent to raising the need to make South Dakota Ave a less violent and more welcoming corridor.

In [Councilmember Parker's February 16th letter to the Mayor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13GBkPfkCKFvKES-ruR0oXcd7g9ww_6tR/view) on budget priorities, he wrote:
> ...I am eager to partner with DDOT to improve many other dangerous arterial corridors in Ward 5, including South Dakota and Michigan Avenues and the other Ward 5 high-injury corridors identified the 2022 update to the Vision Zero Plan. I request that you direct DDOT to leverage existing operational funds to improve safety on these corridors as expeditiously and aggressively as possible.

### DDOT Performance Oversight and Budget Oversight hearings
Sherin Koshy of FoSDANE testified before T&E to the urgency of safety improvements to South Dakota Ave at the 2/27 Performance Oversight and 3/30 Budget Oversight hearings. Chris Leis additionally testified at the 3/30 Budget Oversight hearing.

### ANC resolutions
On March 15th, ANC 5B unanimously passed [a resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13F53xg061I1j3tHeyCgcQ4sO6jF4QMm0/view) reinforcing Councilmember Parker's asks. Among other things, this included resolution "to leverage existing operational funds to improve safety on South Dakota and Michigan Avenues"

[A similar resolution](https://dcgovict-my.sharepoint.com/personal/5c07_anc_dc_gov2/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2F5c07%5Fanc%5Fdc%5Fgov2%2FDocuments%2F20230315%20meeting%2FDraft%5FResolution%5F5C%2DReliable%5FBus%5FService%5FStreet%5FSafety%5FImprovements%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2F5c07%5Fanc%5Fdc%5Fgov2%2FDocuments%2F20230315%20meeting&ga=1) failed to pass ANC 5C the same night.

### T&E Committee markup and draft report
Thanks to the stewardship of Councilmember Parker and Chairperson Allen, the following changes were made to DDOT's budget during markup by the Council Committee on Transportation and the Environment (T&E), per [the draft Committee report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bbd09f3d74562c7f0e4bb10/t/644d83a16f1c072f5af7d4d1/1682801590630/T%26E+DRAFT+FY24+budget+report+FINAL.pdf) released April 26th:
> The Committee is also establishing a new sub-project within DDOT’s Safety & Mobility master project to fund tactical safety improvements on South Dakota Avenue NE. South Dakota Avenue is one of the most dangerous corridors in Ward 5. However, due to the presence of even more dangerous arterial corridors in Ward 5, South Dakota Avenue NE was not designated a high-injury network corridor in DDOT’s 2022 Vision Zero Report. The Committee is placing $1M in the new sub-project to fund efforts to improve safety on the corridor in the short term, preferably by constructing a road diet on a segment of the corridor to calm traffic, reduce injuries, and improve connectivity along the corridor. DDOT shall determine which segment of the corridor would be a suitable starting point for safety improvements; however, the Committee recommends that DDOT consider either the segment between Bladensburg Road and Monroe Street NE or the segment between Sargent Street NE and Riggs Road NE.

### May 11th Site Visit
On May 11th, Councilmember Parker and DDOT Director Everett Lott conducted a site visit and walk along South Dakota Avenue. Members of FoSDANE and many ANC Commissioners representing the roadway (including myself) were present.

### Committee of the Whole action
A forthcoming letter from FoSDANE will emphasize the need to keep this dedicated funding in the FY24 budget as it proceeds to the whole Council.

## Better Bus Network Redesign
There are two new major bus lines proposed as part of [Better Bus Network Redesign](https://wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Better-Bus/index.cfm), which reimagines our bus service for modern needs:
    - [DC214](https://betterbus.wmata.com/downloads/routes/DC214_EN.pdf) (24-hour Fort Lincoln/SDA/RIA/downtown line)
    - [DC207](https://betterbus.wmata.com/downloads/routes/DC207_EN.pdf) (all-day bus line running from Fort Totten to down past Fort Lincoln, covering the entirety of South Dakota Ave)

Folks can provide feedback on the importance of these lines making it into the final set of recommendations.

## history
Part of moving forward is understanding how we got here.

South Dakota Avenue is entirely outside of the original City of Washington designed by Pierre L'Enfant, and has no origins in that plan. By 1898, it appears in the DC Permanent System of Highways master planning document, which implemented Congressional directives to extend the logic of L'Enfant's plan outward to the entire District of Columbia. Some more historical map artifacts on the piecemeal construction below.
