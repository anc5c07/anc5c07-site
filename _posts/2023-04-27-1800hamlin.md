## tl;dr
- **Pleasant Grove Baptist Church is seeking to redevelop** its property at 1800 Hamlin St NE

## The Project
The building plans currently call for five floors plus penthouse of 70 1- and 2-bedroom homes on the south side of the parcel, with a two-floor plus cellar church sanctuary space on the north side of the parcel.

### Project History
At the July 2022 5C07 SMD meeting, the plan was for
- 66 rental homes, including three-bedroom homes and homes in the cellar level
- with around 90% Affordable (income-restricted) (AMI mix not yet decided)
- and a two-story church space (with no homes above it) on the north end of the lot

## Issues
The team is seeking a Voluntary [Design Review](https://dcoz.dc.gov/page/design-review) (VDR) case with the Zoning Commission, all together seeking:
- a little more height in areas of the building
- modification on loading zone requirements
- exemption on minimum off-street parking requirements

The latter two pieces of relief above could be done through a Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) case, but can also be rolled into a single case through the Design Review process. The taller height (presumably justified through some averaging of allowable height for the zone) requires a Design Review (or could otherwise require a more substantial ZC case, such as a Map Amendment).

<p class="caption">notional overhead diagram of the building showing PUDO zones in lieu of parking and loading</p>

The limiting factors cited for the loading zone and parking relief are the lot size and shape, and the desire to make the building more transit- and pedestrian-friendly.

At the 4/26/23 meeting, it was stated that, after discussion with OP, the loading zone would be moved to the Queens Chapel side of the building (not reflected above).

### parking
The [parking minimums](https://online.encodeplus.com/regs/washington-dc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-876) that would be required absent relief are as follows:

|factor|calculation|result
|---|---|---|
|residential|(70 - 4) ÷ 3|22|
|commercial|"1 for each 10 seats of occupancy capacity in the main sanctuary; provided, that where the seats are not fixed, each 7 sq. ft. usable for seating or each 18 in. of bench if benches are provided shall be considered 1 seat."|?|
|total|sum of the above|22+?|

The current plans call for no off-street parking

### Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The parcel is split among four [Future Land Use Map](https://plandc.dc.gov/page/future-land-use-map-and-generalized-policy-map) (FLUM) categories:
- Commercial Low Density (CLD) on the west side (and majority)
- Residential Moderate Density (RMOD)/Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) along the southern edge
- Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) along the eastern edge
- Residential Low Density (RLD) on the northeastern edge

The entire parcel is currently zoned [MU-4](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/pages/ee04322fce1c4bceadd7aa1f5adae2a3#MU-4) ("moderate-density mixed-use development").

## Outreach History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact avenues on the footer of this webpage.
