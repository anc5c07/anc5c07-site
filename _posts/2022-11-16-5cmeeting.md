This is mostly written as a preview still, though I have updated the agenda to reflect what actually occurred.
{: .notice--info}
## tl;dr
- The agenda contained multiple Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration (ABRA) licenses up for standard renewal; action (in support) was taken on a couple, with no action on others
- Contractors for DDOT will be upgrading light fixtures throughout DC early next year
- The Quarterly Treasury Reports for Fiscal Year 2022, Quarter 4 (Calendar Year 2022, Quarter 3) were considered not ready for approval; there will be a special meeting on Monday 11/21 to try again on those.

## Meeting Details
The meeting was held virtually (via WebEx) at **6pm ET** on **Wednesday 11/16/2022**. It was over around 8pm.

This is a regularly scheduled monthly meeting. Full-commission meetings are:
- open to the public
- properly noticed to the public ahead of time
- require a quorum (majority) of Commissioners present (in person or on camera)
- the only suitable venue for official Commission actions (e.g. voting on resolutions/letters)

This meeting was chaired by Vice Chair, Commissioner Thomas, with support from Commissioner Montague, due to Commissioner/Chair Manning not being present. Though she tried to join later, this didn't occur due to technical difficulties. All other Commissioners were present for the call.

## MPD briefing
Inspector Altieri from MPD presented some information and took some questions related to crime. He emphasized that while crime is low in our area, "people aren't stats" and low crime is irrelevant if someone is a victim or fears being a victim. He discussed plans for Walk and Talk events in each ANC area.

He mentioned a couple things to watch out for:
- being aware of [the Pepco scam](https://www.pepco.com/MyAccount/CustomerSupport/Pages/ImpostersandScams.aspx#:~:text=Remember,someone%20you%20do%20not%20recognize)
- being aware of your surroundings if pulling your car over, as this leaves you vulnerable to carjacking or other crime

The was some discussion on a nuisance property at 2400 20th St. NE, with some plans for follow-up with the property owner if squatting is the issue.

## CM McDuffie's office briefing
Kelley Cislo from CM McDuffie's office gave quick comments and took some questions, including about a new program to training software testers at the [Learnix Tree Center](https://www.learnixcenter.com/) funded by DC government grants.

## ABRA Renewals
ABRA licenses allow a business to sell or serve alcohol; they may be issued to stores, restaurants, taverns, bars, or nightclubs, among other business types, and include allowable time periods for various types of sales and activities. You can learn more about [the many license types/classes](https://abra.dc.gov/node/670312) on the ABRA website.

ABRA renewals [can be protested](https://abra.dc.gov/node/1111221) by any of a number of parties with standing. If someone decides to protest, the issue can frequently be resolved by negotiating a [Settlement Agreement](https://abra.dc.gov/page/settlement-agreements) (SA), which adds additional ABRA-enforced provisions to the license. A party with standing must formally notify ABRA that they are protesting before the protest deadline. In the case of an ANC, protesting requires a formal resolution of the ANC.

### cases up for renewal
The licenses originally on the agenda, in order of protest deadline, are:

### discussions
As 5C currently operates, outreach at the SMD level should be done through a meeting before bringing a matter of the full Commission. Only the two cases in 5C07 had received an SMD meeting. All other cases on the agenda were skipped due to lack of an SMD meeting having occurred (or possibly just due to Commissioner Manning's absence in the 5C04 cases).

One case, that of The Public Option, had already passed its protest deadline by the time of this meeting, though Commissioner Thomas (whose current SMD boundaries cover the establishment) did not appear to know this when he deferred on the topic.

As the protest deadlines for all other cases will pass before the next regular meeting of 5C, it seems unlikely SMD Commissioners or the ANC will be acting on the other renewals in time, though it is possible this occurs in a special 5C meeting (such as 11/21's).

The Commission passed unanimous approvals for the two 5C07 cases, though, as licenses are generally approved in the absence of protest, this was not strictly necessary.

## Brookland Manor/RIA DC
This is a long-planned development with a [very lengthy and complicated history](https://ggwash.org/view/63156/brookland-manor-a-crash-course-in-why-housing-in-dc-is-so-complicated). The Zoning approvals for this project had been tangled in court proceedings for some time, but those cases were [finally(?) resolved in mid-2021](https://brooklandbridge.com/19086/development-update-appeals-court-decision-clears-the-way-for-the-massive-ria-brookland-manor-project/).

On the meeting, Commissioner Thomas (while experiencing technicaly difficulties that made a lot of what he said unclear) emphasized a commitment to fair standards for folks who live in Brookland Manor and who have been promised relocation within the development as new buildings come online. Relocation within the development has always been a part of the RIA DC plan, a point that was emphasized in statements and questions/answers by Commissioners Thomas and Oliver, MidCity's Andrew Lee (Directory of Community Engagement), as well as Commissioner-elect Anthony Dale.

## LED lighting
DDOT plans to upgrade to LED lighting DC-wide. There is a lot of background on the [DDOT project page](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/streetlights).

A briefing was given by Ashley Wells and Alese Ballard of Plenary Infrastructure DC, the company [contracted to perform this work](https://plenarygroup.com/news-and-media/news/2022/dc-smart-street-lighting). A few critical points mentioned in the presentation as well as through question/answer:
- Component replacement will be conducted in "bundles" of 2-5 square blocks at a time. Each bundle must contractually be completed with 14 days, with multiple occurring simultaneously across DC at any given time.
- Work should generally occur during the day, with new lighting functional by nightfall.
- ANCs will be notified 45 days before start of work within their area, and there will be distribution of information cards, door knockers, no parking advisories, and then no parking signs, for areas where work is being conducted.
- All of this should commence in the first quarter of next year.

## 17th St. Speedhumps/general Traffic Safety
Commissioner Thomas mentioned seeking an update from DDOT on this at the planning meeting, and said he intended to invite Dalando Baker (DDOT's Community Engagement Specialist for Ward 5) to the meeting. It's unclear whether this invitation was extended, though Mr. Baker did not attend the meeting.

The work for a formal request for traffic safety mitigations (such as speedhumps) is called a Traffic Safety Investigation (TSI), and [DDOT maintains a dashboard for TSI requests](https://ddot.dc.gov/featured-content/traffic-safety-investigation-tsi-dashboard). A TSI request may be submitted with or without a particular mitigation requested, though there is debate about which is more effective. If without, they are simply a request the DDOT look into driver behavior in a certain place and evaluate for any mitigation.

TSIs on the dashboard currently for 17th St NE:

|Service Request no.|ascribed location|mitigations requested|status|
|---|---|---|---|
|22-00487051|2829 17th St NE|pedestrian signal improvements|Pending DDOT Review|
|22-00487048|1653 Franklin St. NE (~2700 blk of 17th)|4-way stop at Franklin/17th|Pending DDOT Review|
|22-00408896|2400 blk 17th St. NE|(unclear from dashboard)|Pending DDOT Review|

In the meeting, Commissioner Thomas specifically mentioned the last SR above as being his request for speedhumps, and noted the aggressive speed with which drivers operate their cars on 17th St. NE when coming off Montana Ave. NE. Commissioner Oliver also discussed various concerns about driver behavior, and mitigations she would like to see. A question was asked about the correct term for flexposts (Commissioners landed on "bollards," though there are many inflexible variations of bollard as well), and Commissioner Oliver mentioned wanting to see many more flexposts installed.

## Secretary's Minutes
5C has had a lot of trouble preparing, approving, or posting Meeting Minutes. There have not been any meeting minutes published on the website since [October 2021](https://www.anc-5c.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ANC-5C-Meeting-Minutes-2021.10.20.pdf).

In the meeting, 5C's Secretary, Commissioner Gail Brevard, refused to read the minutes aloud. They were ultimately approved by a mixed vote. Commissioner Brevard made representations on the chat that the meeting minutes were posted on the website, but did not answer follow-up questions on where.

## Quarterly Financial Report
These must be done every quarter and outline the expenses incurred, money received, and balances for the Commission.

ANC 5C has been sitting on substantial savings (approximately $87k at last report), but Commissioner Oliver, the Treasurer, has been having some trouble submitting the reports. At the last full-commission meeting, the Commission voted to approve the previous report pending corrections that were to be made after the meeting (or they would risk missing another dispersal of funds from the DC Government); it's unclear whether this submission occurred.

In the meeting, this trend continued, with the treasury report ultimately not being approved due to discrepencies and incomplete reporting. A special meeting was scheduled for 11/16 to complete this business.

Constituents on the call, both verbally and in the chat, expressed frustration on the lack 
of secretary's and treasury reports being completed.
