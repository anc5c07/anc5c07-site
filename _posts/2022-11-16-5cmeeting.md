## ABRA Renewals
ABRA licenses allow a business to sell or serve alcohol; they may be issued to stores, restaurants, taverns, bars, or nightclubs, among other business types, and include allowable time periods for various types of sales and activities. You can learn more about [the many license types/classes](https://abra.dc.gov/node/670312) on the ABRA website.

ABRA renewals [can be protested](https://abra.dc.gov/node/1111221) by any of a number of parties with standing. If someone decides to protest, the issue can frequently be resolved by negotiating a [Settlement Agreement](https://abra.dc.gov/page/settlement-agreements) (SA), which adds additional ABRA-enforced provisions to the license. A party with standing must formally notify ABRA that they are protesting before the protest deadline. In the case of an ANC, protesting requires a formal resolution of the ANC.

### cases up for renewal

## Brookland Manor/RIA DC
This is a long-planned development with a [very lengthy and complicated history](https://ggwash.org/view/63156/brookland-manor-a-crash-course-in-why-housing-in-dc-is-so-complicated). The Zoning approvals for this project had been tangled in court proceedings for some time, but those cases were [finally(?) resolved in mid-2021](https://brooklandbridge.com/19086/development-update-appeals-court-decision-clears-the-way-for-the-massive-ria-brookland-manor-project/).

## LED lighting
This will be an update on the LED lighting installation project that DDOT has been planning for some time. The presentation should include some background, as well as installation timelines for the 5C Commission area.

There is a lot of background on the [DDOT project page](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/streetlights)

## 17th St. Speedhumps
Commissioner Thomas mentioned seeking an update from DDOT on this at the planning meeting, and said he intended to invite Dalando Baker (DDOT's Community Engagement Specialist for Ward 5) to the meeting.

A formal request for traffic safety mitigations (such as speedhumps) is called a Traffic Safety Investigation, and [DDOT maintains a dashboard for these](https://ddot.dc.gov/featured-content/traffic-safety-investigation-tsi-dashboard). These may be submitted with or without a particular mitigation requested, though there is debate about which is more effective. If without, they are simply a request the DDOT look into driver behavior in a certain place and evaluate for any mitigation.

TSIs on the dashboard currently for 17th St NE:

|Service Request no.|ascribed location|mitigations requested|status|
|---|---|---|---|
|22-00487051|2829 17th St NE|pedestrian signal improvements|Pending DDOT Review|
|22-00487048|1653 Franklin St. NE (~2700 blk of 17th)|4-way stop at Franklin/17th|Pending DDOT Review|
|22-00408896|2400 blk 17th St. NE|(unclear from dashboard)|Pending DDOT Review|

## Quarterly Financial Report
These must be done every quarter and outline the expenses incurred, money received, and balances for the Commission.

ANC 5C has been sitting on substantial savings (approximately $87k at last report), but Commissioner Oliver, the Treasurer, has been having some trouble submitting the reports. At the last full-commission meeting, the Commission voted to approve the previous report pending corrections that were to be made after the meeting (or they would risk missing another dispersal of funds from the DC Government); it's unclear whether this submission occurred.
