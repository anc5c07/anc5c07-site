# Five Medicine
A [Certificate of Need](https://dchealth.dc.gov/service/certificate-need) is a requirement for establishing a health service establishment in DC. [Five Medicine](https://www.fivemedicine.com/) appears to me a new local provider. It's unclear where they might be planning to open; I have theories but I'll wait for something concrete!

# 1803 Rhode Island Ave. NE
1803 Rhode Island Ave. NE is the site of a single-story retail building and small surface lot, currently occupied by [Soul Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/soul-kitchen-washington).

There have been plans from [Addisleigh Park Washington Properties](https://www.dcbusinesstoolkit.com/businesses/addisleigh-park-washington-properties-llc) and [Upwall Architects](https://www.studioupwall.com/) to redevelop the site for some time, and they've gone through a few revisions, slowly moving from a three-story retail building to a more standard mixed-use building with eight homes over 1000 square feet of retail. I'll cover this in detail in an issue page soon.

This project has gone through multiple zoning cases already; the [current BZA case](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/CaseReportPage.aspx?case_id=20014B) is to extend their time for construction and accomodate the changes in use.

# New York Avenue Framework Project
DC's Office of Planning (OP) began its [New York Avenue Vision Framework](https://planning.dc.gov/NYAroadmap) effort with a kickoff meeting last week. The project "focuses on improving quality of life for residents, planning for housing and jobs along the corridor, and ensuring there is adequate infrastructure" and will include several meetings and community walkabouts along New York Avenue from Brentwood Rd to South Dakota Ave NE. The broader project target region includes all of our SMD.

This is one of several efforts to interpret the revised Comprehensive Plan and prepare to rewrite the Comprehensive Plan in the coming years.

## my take
switching from facts to opinion
{: .notice--warning}
I think anyone attempting to traverse New York Avenue knows the area is made oppressive and unlivable by through traffic and car priority. I believe these projects are an opportunity rebuild this corridor with an urban fabric and less accomodation of vehicular traffic, and that this is essential for making communities along NYA places people can live, work, and enjoy being in.

# CaseyTrees/Langdon Park
CaseyTrees, in collaboration with The Chesapeake Bay Trust (CBT) and the DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE), is working on a walking trail through Langdon Park's forest patch. You can learn more about the project [here](https://caseytrees.org/2022/04/notes-from-the-field-langdon-park/).
