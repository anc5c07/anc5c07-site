## tl;dr
- **The 18th St NE bicycle/mobility lanes** are a set of painted lanes on 18th St NE running in some form for the half mile from Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE
- **The lanes are inconsistent**; running on only one or the other side of the roadway (with sharrows on the other side), and jumping laterally across intersections without guidelines or good visibility
- **This is confusing and unsafe for bikers and drivers alike**; the double-yellow median frequently jumps around with the bike lanes
- **A number of nearby infrastructure improvements, [geographic constraints](#connectivity), and [family-centric amenities](#amenities)** make it especially important that we protect the infrastructure we have as we seek to extend it from Montana to Michigan

## The Need
As DC's low-stress bicycle/mobility priority network grows, we need to keep in mind the necessity for safe and accessible infrastructure along 18th St. There are many reasons, further detailed below:
- there are unique geographic constraints making 18th and Montana a critical connection
- there are many unique and family-focused amenities along the corridor
- this connectivity is considered in the existing MoveDC Bicycle Priority plan
- there are a number of substantial investments in new bicycle/mobility infrastructure being made nearby

### Connectivity
18th St (combined with a segment of Montana Ave) is the middle of only three connections over the railyard and tracks extending east from the Metropolitan Branch tracks/trail. The three connections, from west to east, are:
- Brentwood Rd NE/9th St NE
- 18th St NE/Montana Ave NE
- Queens Chapel Rd NE/Bladensburg Road NE

### Amenities
The 18th St corridor is home to nine schools, four parks, a library, a rec center, a public pool, a large senior assisted living facility, two forest patches, and several future growth areas, making safe and corridor-long connectivity crucial.

The existing (in need of improvement) bicycle/mobility lanes connect Woodridge Library, Langdon Park, Langdon Elementary, and the DACL assisted living facility.

#### specifics
Institutions along the whole corridor spelled out:
- many schools
  - 2-3 DCPS elementary schools (Langdon ES, John Burroughs ES; Bunker Hill ES is just a bit off the corridor)
  - the Taft Middle School building, which currently houses:
    - three charter schools (Perry St Prep, Sojourner Truth, Latin American Bilingual Montessori (LAMB))
    - a private school (St. Jerome Institute)
    - a dance school (Princess Mhoon Dance Institute (PMDI))
  - a school's makerspace (Center City Public Charter's upcoming facility on the 2300 block)
- one of Ward 5's only two Public Libraries (Woodridge Neighborhood Library)
- three DPR Parks (Loomis, Langdon, Dwight Mosley) plus the popular publicly accessible playground and field at Burroughs ES
- Langdon Park's many unique amenities for the area: a [soon-to-be-modernized recreation center](/issues/langdonrec), a public pool, a skate park
- a senior assisted living facility (Department of Aging and Community Living's center on the 2500 block)
- two forest patches (Langdon Park's and the [South Langdon/Queens Chapel/Paper Street Forest Patch](/issues/paperstreetforestpatch/))
- other large institutional landmasses (Howard University Divinity School and Franciscan Monastery just off the corridor)
- retail areas along Rhode Island Ave and in a small cluster around 18th/Monroe

### MoveDC plan
[DDOT's MoveDC Bicycle Priority plans](https://movedc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/bicycles) include plans for future improvement along all of Montana Ave, and 18th St north from the existing lanes to South Dakota Ave NE. 18th St provides a uniquely necessary north-south route parallel with the existing (and now finally complete) MBT/8th St route.

### Nearby Projects
A number of important projects are moving forward nearby, and better connectivity on and around 18th St NE will be critical for connectivity to and among them. These projects include:
- [The 8th St safety improvements](https://ddot.dc.gov/8thstreetne), nearing completion, which implemented a protected two-way cycletrack on 8th St NE to bridge the gap between the two existing segments of the Metropolitan Branch Trail (MBT), creating a comprehensive north-south route just under a mile west of 18th St NE
- [The New York Ave NE trail project](https://nyave.ddot.dc.gov/) to create mixed-used trails on either side of New York Ave NE
- [The Bladensburg Road Multimodal Safety and Access Study](https://engage.dc.gov/BladensburgSafetyStudy) which would implement curbside protected bicycle/mobility lanes across the entire span of Bladensburg Road NE
- [The Mount Olivet Rd multimodal improvements](https://ddotwiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NI/pages/2207023106/NOI-23-93-TESD) to implement a protected two-way cycletrack on Mount Olivet Road from 9th/Brentwood to Bladensburg
- [Taylor St NE improvements](https://twitter.com/FixCircle/status/1695908672398889148) may create a new east-west low-stress route from the MBT to some eastern terminus (possibly as far as SDA or 18th St)

## Attempts to put this on DDOT's radar
In the absence of any serious plans to improve 18th St, I've been trying to keep this on DDOT's radar as I submit comments for tangentially related matters, such as:
- [Letter in Support of NOI-23-158-TESD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R6REc9kHooIGKxlQn47hRYsVynsp58Du/view?usp=sharing) for an all-way stop control at 18th/Bryant
- [Letter in Support of NOI-23-161-PSD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OFh5r-EAojshX_Lwy35_-9btImaIC-Ew/view?usp=sharing) to fill the two-block gap in painted K St NE bicycle/mobility lanes separating them from the southern terminus of the West Virginia Ave lanes (which would connect across New York Avenue to Montana Ave/18th St to the north)

## Present Condition
From Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE, 18th St NE is 42 feet wide, typically divided as follows, from west to east:
- 8-foot south-bound delineated parking lane
- 10-foot south-bound driving lane
- a double-yellow center line
- 10-foot north-bound driving lane
- 8-foot north-bound delineated parking lane
- a 5-foot bike lane, running between the parking lane and driving lane in one given direction

### Montana to Bryant
[![Looking south from Bryant](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-bryant.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-bryant.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south from Bryant</p>
This is the only segment that deviates from the above standard form, and for which the bike lanes run in both directions.
- **north-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between a 13-foot driving lane and the curb, in an area with a few very wide curb cuts
- **south-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between an 8-foot delineated parking lane and a 10-foot drive lane

### Bryant switch
[![Looking north to Bryant](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-bryant.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-bryant.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to Bryant</p>
At Bryant, which has decent visibility, the roadway realigns to standard form on the north side:
- **north-bound** the bike lane jumps to the left to accommodate the introduction of a north-bound parking lane and a shrinking (13 feet to 10 feet) north-bound drive lane
- **south-bound** sharrows become a painted bike lane
- **the double-yellow** center-line jumps to the west looking north, with a dotted guideline painted through the intersection

### Bryant to Douglas
[![Looking south to Channing](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-channing.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-channing.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Bryant</p>
For the stretch from Bryant to Douglas, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### Douglas switch
[![Looking north to Douglas](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-douglas.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-douglas.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to Douglas</p>
Douglas and 18th is a three-way intersection, with the Center for Aging facility parking lot entrance on the east side just north and south of the intersection. The north-bound and south-bound bike lanes both end into sharrows in their respective direction over a blind hill at a pair of unsignalized crosswalks.

This is the only switch in which the road's center line does not jump.

### Douglas to Franklin
[![Looking south to Evarts](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-evarts.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-evarts.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Evarts</p>
For the stretch from Douglas to Franklin, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane south-bound and sharrows north-bound.

### Franklin switch
[![Looking south to Franklin](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-franklin.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-franklin.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Franklin</p>
At Franklin, a dip in the road makes for heightened visibility as sharrows switch to painted lanes in each direction. The center-line jumps, without a dotted guideline through the intersection.

### Franklin to Rhode Island
[![Looking north to RIA](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-dock.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-dock.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south from the CaBi dock</p>
For the stretch from Franklin to Rhode Island, the roadway resembles the standard form above with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### RIA intersection
[![Looking north to RIA](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-ria.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-ria.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to RIA</p>
Just before the Woodridge Library parking lot, an on-street Capital Bikeshare dock is present in the parking lane, and north of that, the bike lane veers into the library curb cut to make room for a left-turn pocket lane onto Rhode Island Ave.

## Adjacent roadways
### Montana and south
[![Looking west from Adams](/assets/images/18thst/west-from-adams.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/west-from-adams.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking west from Adams</p>
A slip lane carries 18th St right on Montana.

[![Looking south to Montana and W](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Montana and W</p>
18th St itself veers right to a segment of W St largely fronting a DDOT facility and ending at a pocket park with no through access for drivers.

Turning left onto Montana from 18th leads to a short segment passing under railroad track and to Montana Circle; the junction of Montana, New York, and West Virginia Avenues.

### North of RIA
18th St shrinks considerably north of RIA, with a 32-37 foot wide fluctuation from RIA to Irving, and then a standard 29-foot crosswidth (with a double-yellow line and parking only southbound) up to past South Dakota Ave.
