This community concern runs through 5C07, but also along the boundary of 5C06 and 5C02.

## tl;dr
- **The 18th St NE bike lanes** are a set of painted lanes on 18th St NE running in some form for the half mile from Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE, that were installed sometime in the 2007-2009 timeframe
- **The lanes are inconsistent**; running on only one or the other side of the roadway (with sharrows on the other side), and jumping laterally across intersections without guidelines or good visibility
- **This is confusing and unsafe for bikers and drivers alike**; the double-yellow median frequently jumps around with the bike lanes
- **A number of nearby infrastructure improvements** and long-term plans to extend the bike priority along 18th St NE make it a good time to push for improvements to this infrastructure

## Present Condition
From Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE, 18th St NE is 42 feet wide, typically divided as follows, from west to east:
- 8-foot south-bound delineated parking lane
- 10-foot south-bound driving lane
- a double-yellow center line
- 10-foot north-bound driving lane
- 8-foot north-bound delineated parking lane
- a 5-foot bike lane, running between the parking lane and driving lane in one given direction

### Montana to Bryant

<p class="caption">Looking south from Bryant</p>
This is the only segment that deviates from the above standard form, and for which the bike lanes run in both directions.
- **north-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between a 13-foot driving lane and the curb, in an area with a few very wide curb cuts
- **south-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between an 8-foot delineated parking lane and a 10-foot drive lane

### Bryant switch

<p class="caption">Looking north to Bryant</p>
At Bryant, which has decent visibility, the roadway realigns to standard form on the north side:
- **north-bound** the bike lane jumps to the left to accommodate the introduction of a north-bound parking lane and a shrinking (13 feet to 10 feet) north-bound drive lane
- **south-bound** sharrows become a painted bike lane
- **the double-yellow** center-line jumps to the west looking north, with a dotted guideline painted through the intersection

### Bryant to Douglas

<p class="caption">Looking south to Bryant</p>
For the stretch from Bryant to Douglas, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### Douglas switch

<p class="caption">Looking north to Douglas</p>
Douglas and 18th is a three-way intersection, with the Center for Aging facility parking lot entrance on the east side just north and south of the intersection. The north-bound and south-bound bike lanes both end into sharrows in their respective direction over a blind hill at a pair of unsignalized crosswalks.

This is the only switch in which the road's center line does not jump.

### Douglas to Franklin

<p class="caption">Looking south to Evarts</p>
For the stretch from Douglas to Franklin, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane south-bound and sharrows north-bound.

### Franklin switch

<p class="caption">Looking south to Franklin</p>
At Franklin, a dip in the road makes for heightened visibility as sharrows switch to painted lanes in each direction. The center-line jumps, without a dotted guideline through the intersection.

### Franklin to Rhode Island

For the stretch from Franklin to Rhode Island, the roadway resembles the standard form above with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### RIA intersection

Just before the Woodridge Library parking lot, an on-street Capital Bikeshare dock is present in the parking lane, and north of that, the bike lane veers into the library curb cut to make room for a left-turn pocket lane onto Rhode Island Ave.

## Adjacent roadways
### Montana and south

<p class="caption">Looking west from Adams</p>
A slip lane carries 18th St right on Montana.

[![Looking south to Montana and W](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Montana and W</p>
18th St itself veers right to a segment of W St largely fronting a DDOT facility and ending at a pocket park with no through access for drivers.

Turning left onto Montana from 18th leads to a short segment passing under railroad track and to Montana Circle; the junction of Montana, New York, and West Virginia Avenues.

### North of RIA
18th St shrinks considerably north of RIA, with a 32-37 foot wide fluctuation from RIA to Irving, and then a standard 29-foot crosswidth (with a double-yellow line and parking only southbound) up to past South Dakota Ave.
