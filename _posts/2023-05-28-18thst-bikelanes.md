This community concern runs through 5C07, but also along the boundary of 5C06 and 5C02.

## tl;dr
- **The 18th St NE bicycle/mobility lanes** are a set of painted lanes on 18th St NE running in some form for the half mile from Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE
- **The lanes are inconsistent**; running on only one or the other side of the roadway (with sharrows on the other side), and jumping laterally across intersections without guidelines or good visibility
- **This is confusing and unsafe for bikers and drivers alike**; the double-yellow median frequently jumps around with the bike lanes
- **A number of nearby infrastructure improvements, [geographic constraints](#connectivity), and [family-centric amenities](#amenities)** make it especially important that we protect the infrastructure we have as we seek to extend it from Montana to Michigan

## The Need
As DC's low-stress bicycle/mobility priority network grows, we need to keep in mind the necessity for safe and accessible infrastructure along 18th St. There are many reasons, further detailed below:
- it's already in the MoveDC plan
- there are unique geographic constraints making 18th and Montana a critical connection
- there are many unique and family-focused amenities along the corridor

### MoveDC plan
It's in [DC DDOT's plans already](https://movedc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/bicycles). 18th St provides a uniquely necessary north-south route.

### Connectivity
18th St (and a segment of Montana Ave) are the middle of only three safe connections east of the Metropolitan Branch tracks/trail over the railyards. It is critical that this connection be made safe.

### Amenities
The 18th St corridor is home to nine schools, four parks, a library, a rec center, a public pool, a large senior assisted living facility, two forest patches, and other future growth areas, making safe and corridor-long connectivity crucial.

The existing (in need of improvement) bicycle/mobility lanes connect Woodridge Library, Langdon Park, Langdon Elementary, and the DACL assisted living facility.

### more specifics
Some more institutions along the whole corridor:
- many schools
  - 2-3 DCPS elementary schools (Langdon ES, John Burroughs ES; Bunker Hill ES is just a bit off the corridor)
  - the Taft Middle School building, which currently houses:
    - three charter schools (Perry St Prep, Sojourner Truth, Latin American Bilingual Montessori (LAMB))
    - a private school (St. Jerome Institute)
    - a dance school (Princess Mhoon Dance Institute (PMDI))
  - a school's makerspace (Center City Public Charter's upcoming facility on the 2300 block)
- one of Ward 5's only two Public Libraries (Woodridge Neighborhood Library)
- three DPR Parks (Loomis, Langdon, Dwight Mosley) plus a popular publicly accessible playground at Burroughs ES
- Langdon Park's many unique amenities for the area: a [soon-to-be-modernized recreation center](/issues/langdonrec), a public pool, a skate park
- a senior assisted living facility (Department of Aging and Community Living's center on the 2500 block)
- two forest patches (Langdon Park's and the [South Langdon/Queens Chapel/Paper Street Forest Patch](/issues/paperstreetforestpatch/))
- other large institutional landmasses (Howard University Divinity School and Franciscan Monastery just off the corridor)
- retail areas along Rhode Island Ave and in a small cluster around 18th/Monroe

## Present Condition
From Montana Ave NE to Rhode Island Ave NE, 18th St NE is 42 feet wide, typically divided as follows, from west to east:
- 8-foot south-bound delineated parking lane
- 10-foot south-bound driving lane
- a double-yellow center line
- 10-foot north-bound driving lane
- 8-foot north-bound delineated parking lane
- a 5-foot bike lane, running between the parking lane and driving lane in one given direction

### Montana to Bryant
[![Looking south from Bryant](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-bryant.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-bryant.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south from Bryant</p>
This is the only segment that deviates from the above standard form, and for which the bike lanes run in both directions.
- **north-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between a 13-foot driving lane and the curb, in an area with a few very wide curb cuts
- **south-bound** the 5-foot painted bike lane runs between an 8-foot delineated parking lane and a 10-foot drive lane

### Bryant switch
[![Looking north to Bryant](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-bryant.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-bryant.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to Bryant</p>
At Bryant, which has decent visibility, the roadway realigns to standard form on the north side:
- **north-bound** the bike lane jumps to the left to accommodate the introduction of a north-bound parking lane and a shrinking (13 feet to 10 feet) north-bound drive lane
- **south-bound** sharrows become a painted bike lane
- **the double-yellow** center-line jumps to the west looking north, with a dotted guideline painted through the intersection

### Bryant to Douglas
[![Looking south to Channing](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-channing.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-channing.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Bryant</p>
For the stretch from Bryant to Douglas, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### Douglas switch
[![Looking north to Douglas](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-douglas.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-douglas.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to Douglas</p>
Douglas and 18th is a three-way intersection, with the Center for Aging facility parking lot entrance on the east side just north and south of the intersection. The north-bound and south-bound bike lanes both end into sharrows in their respective direction over a blind hill at a pair of unsignalized crosswalks.

This is the only switch in which the road's center line does not jump.

### Douglas to Franklin

<p class="caption">Looking south to Evarts</p>
For the stretch from Douglas to Franklin, the roadway resembles the standard form above, with the bike lane south-bound and sharrows north-bound.

### Franklin switch
[![Looking south to Franklin](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-franklin.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-franklin.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Franklin</p>
At Franklin, a dip in the road makes for heightened visibility as sharrows switch to painted lanes in each direction. The center-line jumps, without a dotted guideline through the intersection.

### Franklin to Rhode Island
[![Looking north to RIA](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-dock.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-from-dock.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south from the CaBi dock</p>
For the stretch from Franklin to Rhode Island, the roadway resembles the standard form above with the bike lane north-bound and sharrows south-bound.

### RIA intersection
[![Looking north to RIA](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-ria.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/north-to-ria.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking north to RIA</p>
Just before the Woodridge Library parking lot, an on-street Capital Bikeshare dock is present in the parking lane, and north of that, the bike lane veers into the library curb cut to make room for a left-turn pocket lane onto Rhode Island Ave.

## Adjacent roadways
### Montana and south
[![Looking west from Adams](/assets/images/18thst/west-from-adams.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/west-from-adams.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking west from Adams</p>
A slip lane carries 18th St right on Montana.

[![Looking south to Montana and W](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)](/assets/images/18thst/south-to-montana-and-w.jpg)
<p class="caption">Looking south to Montana and W</p>
18th St itself veers right to a segment of W St largely fronting a DDOT facility and ending at a pocket park with no through access for drivers.

Turning left onto Montana from 18th leads to a short segment passing under railroad track and to Montana Circle; the junction of Montana, New York, and West Virginia Avenues.

### North of RIA
18th St shrinks considerably north of RIA, with a 32-37 foot wide fluctuation from RIA to Irving, and then a standard 29-foot crosswidth (with a double-yellow line and parking only southbound) up to past South Dakota Ave.
