<div id="development-map" class="map-container"></div>
This is an expected future development with no active plans or cases.
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- **2100 Rhode Island Ave NE is a 14,810 square foot lot** at the southeast corner of 20th and RIA
- **Local Teamsters union chapters** most recently occupied the building currently on the site
- **The building is pending sale** and the purchaser has indicated an intention to redevelop the property
- **The developer is skeptical of building retail** on the site in addition to homes, but I'm working with various community groups to make the case for retail

## Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The site is categorized as Residential Moderate Density (RMOD)/Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) in the Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map (FLUM). It is currently zoned MU-4.

## Outreach History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact avenues on the footer of this webpage.
