This project is in 5B03.
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- This is a 12-home building on a lot that currently contains a detached single-family house
- One unique feature about this building is the presence of two cellar floors with homes
- In the DC Zoning Code, a cellar floor is one for which the ceiling is less than 4 feet above grade, and therefore does not count against a building's allowable height (4+ feet is considered a "basement" which does count).
- The cellar floors receive natural light an egress through deep wells adjacent on the perimeter of the building.
- The zoning relief sought is to not build the single required parking space for a building of this size, zone, and transit proximity
- You can submit testimony on the BZA case! [Instructions below](#community-action).

## Official Sources
