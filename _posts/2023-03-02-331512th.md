This project is in 5B03, which borders 5C07 across the 5B/5C boundary; I have no formal vote on this project. The 5B03 seat is [vacant for now](#5b03-vacancy).
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- This is a proposed 12-home building on a lot that currently contains a detached single-family house
- One unique feature about this building is the presence of [two cellar floors with homes](#cellars)
- The building will have no off-street vehicle parking spaces, necessitating zoning variance for [1-2 parking spaces](#parking-requirements)
- At the 3/7 5B meeting, the developer indicated they may also need penthouse setback relief [due to penthouse shape](#penthouse-setback)
- You can submit testimony on the BZA case! [Instructions below](#community-action).

## Official Sources
This case is being heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, which hears cases involving small zoning variance.

## Meeting History

|date|body|summary|
|---|---|---|
|3/7/2023|[ANC 5B](https://www.anc5b.org/)|A special ANC meeting dedicated to this building|
|3/15/2023|ANC 5B|Monthly Full-Commission meeting where this case may receive a vote|

## Issues
There are various considerations, both directly and indirectly related to the sought zoning variance.

### 5B03 vacancy
For at least the first two months of 2023, Single Member District 5B03 did not have representation due to Commissioner-elect Alicia Egolum moving out of the district between the election and the term starting.

Cyril Crocker will take the 5B03 seat after being the only candidate to submit signatures within a single cycle of the vacancy being posted, but as of the 3/7 meeting, he was still waiting for the official notice of his certification (at which time he would then need to be sworn in by Councilmember).

It's unclear if he would be sworn in ahead of a vote on this BZA case, which would likely occur on Wednesday 3/15.

### Zone
This building is in an [`MU-3A`](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/pages/mixed-use-mu-zones#MU-3) zone. This zone allows:
- commercial uses in [`Use Group D`](https://online.encodeplus.com/regs/washington-dc/doc-viewer.aspx?tocid=001.007.004.004.003#secid-4684): a category including most neighborhood retail uses
- a maximum `floor area ratio` of 1.0 for non-residential use
- a maximum `floor area ratio` of 1.0 for residential uses not including inclusionary zoning
- a maximum `floor area ratio` of 1.2 for residential uses that do include inclusionary zoning
- a maximum height of 40 feet, 3 stories (not counting penthouse)

#### retail
At the 3/7 5B Meeting, Commissioners Piekara and Sen noted the lack of retail in this building. While retail is an option for the MU-3B zone, it is not a requirement. In providing two levels of below-grade housing that wouldn't likely be built under a retail space, this building is essentially swapping possible ground-floor retail for three floors of homes.

### Cellars
Zoning in DC makes a specific distinction between a `cellar` and a `basement`; per [11 DCMR § 199](https://www.dcregs.dc.gov/ContentSearch.aspx?searchText=cellar&DocType=DCMR):
> **Cellar** - that portion of a story, the ceiling of which is less than four feet (4 ft.) above the adjacent finished grade.

and

> **Basement** - that portion of a story partly below grade, the ceiling of which is four feet (4 ft.) or more above the adjacent finished grade. 

The floor space of a `cellar` is not included in tabulating the `gross floor area`, which in turn is used to compute the `floor area ratio`; per the same DCMR section (emphasis added):

> **Gross floor area** - the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of all buildings on the lot... The term "gross floor area" **shall include basements**, elevator shafts, and stairwells at each story; floor space used for mechanical equipment... penthouses; attic space... interior balconies; and mezzanines.
>
> The term "gross floor area" **shall not include cellars** and outside balconies that do not exceed a projection of six feet (6 ft.) beyond the exterior walls of the building. (Case 62-32, May 29, 1962)

and

> **Floor area ratio** - a figure that expresses the total gross floor area as a multiple of the area of the lot. This figure is determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the area of that lot.

The `floor area ratio` is one of the dimensions of a building that is limited by zoning, depending on the zone the building is in.

The building, as planned, has two cellar floors, each containing three homes. These floors receive light and egress through deep wells at the exterior walls of the building. It's unclear if there are any examples of subcellar dwellings within DC to date.

Attendees at the 3/7 meeting expressed concerns about the habitability of these homes, but the developer indicated they would be especially affordable. They would likely be both quieter and more energy-efficient relative to above-grade units.

### Parking Requirements
Typically, a residential building in DC requires one parking space per three homes after the first four.

This building has 12 homes as planned, so: 

**(12 - 4) ÷ 3 = 2.666** which rounds to **3**.

Because this building is close to multiple transit lines, including the Brookland metro and high-frequency buses, there is a reduction by a half. There is some uncertainty about how this is applied. Previously, this was computed before rounding:

**((12 - 4) ÷ 3) ÷ 2 = 2.666 ÷ 2 = 1.333** which rounds to **1**.

but the land use attorney representing the developer of this building expressed concern the [new zoning administrator](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/major-shake-up-in-the-department-of-1093118/) may change the computations to apply the halving after rounding:

**(12 - 4) ÷ 3 = 2.666** which rounds to **3** ⇒<br/>**3 ÷ 2 = 1.5** which rounds to **2**

Regardless of which computation is used, the developer intends to build zero parking spaces, so the only change would be the amount of variance sought in this case.

There was discussion at the 3/7 5B meeting about restricting residents of the building from claiming Residential Parking Permits, despite the site being on an RPP-zoned block. The developer will look into limiting RPP access to residents, but it does not seem likely to occur.

#### bike parking
The building is planned to contain various amenities related to bike parking. During the 3/7 presentation to 5B, Commissioners Costello and Borrego made note of multiple opportunity to increase the usability of these facilities, including larger spacing and charging capacity for ebikes, to further improve the appeal of this building to car-free and car-light families. The developer was receptive to these changes.

### Penthouse Setback
The penthouse level of this building is flush with the building footprint on one side. As seen from the front:

[![front elevation](/assets/images/331512th/front-elevation.png)](/assets/images/331512th/front-elevation.png)
<p class="caption">front elevation diagram of the building</p>

Penthouse setbacks are generally a requirement for visual reasons, as the top floor is less visible when viewing from the ground. The developer has said this setback change is offsetting allowable penthouse space; not creating additional floor area.

### Affordable Housing
This building is planned to have one [Inclusionary Zoning](https://planning.dc.gov/inclusionaryzoning) (income-restricted) home. The developer will additionally be making a contribution to DC's [Housing Production Trust Fund](https://dhcd.dc.gov/page/housing-production-trust-fund).

Notably, the single IZ home will be on the first (at-grade) floor (unit 9); the six homes across two cellar floors will be market-rate, which will likely result in homes that are more affordable the typical for a brand new building in Brookland with close proximity to the metro.

These homes likely provide a number of unique amenities as well:
- they would be heavily insulated from street noise
- they would be insulated from weather as well, likely being very energy-efficient/inexpensive to heat/cool
- homes on the subcellar level will also have private outdoor spaces in the area-way (access well)

## Community Action
[Anyone can submit comments](https://dcoz.dc.gov/node/1211256) in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the BZA when judging the application. Feel free to reach out to me or your Commissioner if you aren't sure what to write. You may also choose to speak at the hearing, but you will have to submit written comments either way.
