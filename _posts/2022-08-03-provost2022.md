## tl;dr
- [Provost](https://www.provostdc.com/) is a **restaurant at 2129 Rhode Island Ave. NE** that serves alcohol
- The existing liquor license has **community-requested provisions** attached
- **Those provisions restrict** any "nightclub"-like activity, VIP table/bottle service, any cover charges, any dancefloor, and any speaker use on the roofdeck
- While **renewing the license**, they would like to **eliminate or modify those provisions**

## Official Sources
This case will be heard by the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration (ABRA).

## Background
[Provost](https://www.provostdc.com/) is a (black woman-owned) restaurant, describing itself as "a laid back, American style restaurant with soul food roots serving organic fare in a gorgeous setting." They are currently open fairly limited hours to the public (Friday-Sunday), but were open more prepandemic and host private events as well. Provost's owner, Nina Gilchrist, is a long-time resident of the neighborhood. They have a bar and seating downstairs, as well as a roofdeck bar and seating area.

When they opened, Provost [struggled to gain community approval](https://brooklandbridge.com/15252/neighbors-seek-to-protest-liquor-license-application-at-rhode-island-aves-provost/) for its licensing to serve alcohol. The end result was a "Settlement Agreement" (SA), a document attached to Provost's license including additional community-negotiated provisions, and enforced by ABRA. For unclear reasons, possibly due to the full Commission being unavailable or unwilling to support in the process, the existing SA was negotiated with the then-sitting Commissioners in 5C07 (Yolanda Odunsi) and 5C02 (Kevin Mullone) and a group of nearby residents, rather than by ANC 5C. Groups of residents and ANCs are both accepted/common parties, though it might be unusual for the named residents in the former case to be sitting Commissioners.

The [Settlement Agreement can be read in full](https://abra.dc.gov/publication/2129-rhode-island-avenue-ne-march-14-2018-settlement-agreement), but the relevant provisions, reproduced here verbatim, include:
1. The license holder's hours of operation and hours of sale, service, and consumption of alcoholic beverages for the interior shall not begin before 8:00 a.m. or exceed 2:00 a.m. on any day of the week.
1. The license holder's hours of operation and hours of sale, service, and consumption of alcoholic beverages for the summer garden shall not begin before 8:00 a.m. on any day of the week or exceed 12:00 a.m., Sunday through Thursday, or 1:00 a.m. on Friday or Saturday.
1. The conditions contained in this Order shall not prevent or prohibit the license holder from applying for, receiving, or operating under any extended hours or additional hours granted under the law.
1. The license holder shall not operate the establishment as a nightclub.
1. The license holder shall not have cover charges.
1. The license holder shall not have a dance floor.
1. The license holder shall not have VIP table service.
1. The license holder shall not have VIP bottle service.

## my take
switching from facts to opinion
{: .notice--warning}

I believe we should support this neighborhood business and give them discretion, within reason, to operate how the management finds best balances the needs of the neighborhood and the need to be financially successful. While I don't expect a full elimination of the SA as a matter of circumstances, I do believe some provisions can be eliminated, and all can be modified for more latitude in operating.
