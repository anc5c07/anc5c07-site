Provost is seeking a renewal of its ABRA license, to be heard 8/15/2022. The current Settlement Agreement with the community bars Provost from having a dance floor, charging any cover fees for events, and having any amplification or electronics speakers on their roofdeck. It also precludes VIP table service, VIP bottle service, or "operating as a nightclub."
