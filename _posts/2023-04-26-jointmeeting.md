## tl;dr
- Our **monthly hybrid** (in-person and virtual) **joint** ([5B06](https://anc5b06.com) and 5C07) **SMD meeting**.
- **We'll have presentations** from **the Commissioners**, **Aurora Market**, and possibly **Xscape Lounge**
- Any other community updates or suggestions welcome

## Background
**This is a joint meeting of SMDs 5B06 and 5C07** to be held on **3/22/2023** starting at 7pm. **The meeting will be hybrid;** in person at Woodridge Library and virtually over Microsoft Teams.

Single-Member District meetings are:
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners
- a chance to discuss issues with their immediate constituents
- not a venue for any official actions
- more common in some parts of DC than others

## Physical Location
The meeting will be at Woodridge Library (1801 Hamlin St. NE), upstairs in Conference Room B. The room has a 20-person capacity. We'll continue to improve our hybrid meeting techniques, hopefully using a camera tripod and hooking up to the conference room television this time.

There will be a children's craft/play corner set up.

## Virtual Connection Details
The meeting will be available virtually on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).

I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact avenues on the footer of this webpage.
