## tl;dr
- Our **monthly hybrid** (in-person and virtual) **joint** ([5B06](https://anc5b06.com) and 5C07) **SMD meeting**.
- **We'll have presentations** from **the Commissioners**, **Aurora Market**, **Xscape Restaurant Lounge**, and the developers of **1800 Hamlin St NE**
- Any other community updates or suggestions welcome

## Background
If these terms are confusing and/or you don't know if you live in 5B06 or 5C07, [visit the FAQ](/ancs/) or [the OpenANC map](https://openanc.org).
{: .notice--warning}

**This is a joint meeting of SMDs 5B06 and 5C07** to be held on **3/22/2023** starting at 7pm. **The meeting will be hybrid;** in person at Woodridge Library and virtually over Microsoft Teams.

Single-Member District meetings are:
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners
- per cultural norms, a precondition to bring official actions to 5B and 5C
- a chance to discuss issues with their immediate constituents
- not a venue for any official actions
- more common in some parts of DC than others

## Physical Location
The meeting will be at Woodridge Library (1801 Hamlin St. NE), upstairs in Conference Room B. The room has a 20-person capacity. We'll continue to improve our hybrid meeting techniques, hopefully using a camera tripod and hooking up to the conference room television this time.

There will be a children's craft/play corner set up.

## Virtual Connection Details
The meeting will be available virtually on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).

    - [DC208](https://betterbus.wmata.com/downloads/routes/DC208_EN.pdf) (all-day Fort Totten/Ivy City/Union Market/Union Station line)
    - carrying forward of many other lines: H6 becomes DC212, all four running RIA routes get new names
- A presentation by [Aurora Market](https://auroramarket.biz/) on their new lease of 2006 Rhode Island Ave NE (formerly Good Foods Market) and alcohol licensing matters

## Aurora Market
Aurora Market is a neighborhood grocer and event space planning to soft-open on May 6th in the old Good Food Market space (2006 Rhode Island Ave NE) with a Grand Opening on June 3rd. The owners are nearby neighbors, and already operate one location in Park View (500 Irving St NW).

[![Aurora Market setting up!](/assets/images/aurora/setting-up.jpg)](/assets/images/aurora/setting-up.jpg)
<p class="caption">Aurora Market setting up!</p>

They are seeking a Class B Retail license (to sell alcohol as part of grocery operations) and a Class C Tavern license (to serve alcohol in the basement event space). I'll share the ABCA placard here once it's posted. Aurora Market has voluntarily offered their existing [Settlement Agreement](https://abca.dc.gov/page/settlement-agreements) (SA) as a template ([it can be read here](https://abca.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/abra/publication/attachments/500%20Irving%20Street%20NW%20-%203%201%202023.pdf)), and is also seeking approval for a [Stipulated License](https://abca.dc.gov/page/stipulated-licenses) (SL) to begin operating with ANC approval before they have their final licensing.

### ABCA/ANC processes
An alcohol license [can be protested](https://abca.dc.gov/page/license-protests) by:
- "an affected ANC" (in this case, 5B for sure and probably also 5C. Seeking clarity.)
- a duly registered civic group covering the area
- an adjacent property owner
- a group of no fewer than five nearby residents

Interplay of events in the case of a Stipulated License and voluntary Settlement Agreement:
- Once a stipulated license is approved by "the" affected ANC (presumably only 5B; seeking clarity), the business can begin licensed operations.
- If a protest by one of the above parties with standing is entered, the business can no longer operate on the Stipulated License.
- Once a Settlement Agreement is approved by "an" affected ANC, that last category of residents is no longer eligible to protest.

It is likely that both the SL and SA will be voted on by 5B on 5/17, and that 5C will likely vote on the SA that same evening. Aurora Market should be able to operate as a grocer without active alcohol operations throughout this process, though there can certainly be business challenges associated with the lack of some business functions/revenue related to alcohol.

### Placard details
This placard hasn't posted yet.

## Xscape Restaurant and Lounge
Xscape Restaurant and Lounge is planning to open in the old SIP/1812 Lounge space (1812 Hamlin St NE, the space on the left that shares an address with Rhode Island Ave Liquors to the right).

I am well-aware of the long history of problems with the previous occupants of this space. I've confirmed with the owner that she has no personal or financial relationship to the old businesses that occupied this space whatsoever. She is hoping to substantially renovate the space as well.

### ABCA/ANC processes
It's still unclear whether Xscape is seeking a Stipulated License or a voluntary Settlement Agreement, but we'll be working with the owner on these details. If seeking both, the process would look like Aurora Market's above.

The protest deadline for this application is **5/22/2023**; absent a deferral or a special meeting, any actions on this will need to be taken at **the 5/17 regular meetings**.

## 1800 Hamlin St NE (Pleasant Grove Baptist Church)
This project was previously briefed to a 5C07 Single-Member District on July 13th, 2022 ([video](https://dcnet.webex.com/webappng/sites/dcnet/recording/6ce78429e525103abbff005056813512/playback)).

<p class="caption">Rendering from the north, showing the church space in front</p>

At that time, the plan was for
- 66 rental homes
- with around 90% Affordable (income-restricted) (AMI mix to be decided)
- and a two-story church space (with no homes above it) on the north end of the lot

They were seeking a voluntary [Design Review](https://dcoz.dc.gov/page/design-review) case with the Zoning Commission, all together seeking:
- a little more height in areas of the building
- variance on loading zone requirements
- variance on minimum off-street parking requirements

The latter two variances above could be done through a Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) case, but can also be rolled into a single case through the Design Review process. The taller height (presumably justified through some averaging of allowable height for the zone) requires a Design Review (or could otherwise require a more substantial ZC case, such as a Map Amendment).

The limiting factors cited for the loading zone and parking relief were the lot size and shape, and the desire to make the building more transit- and pedestrian-friendly.

## Notification History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact avenues on the footer of this webpage.
