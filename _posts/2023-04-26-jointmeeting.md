## tl;dr
- Our **monthly hybrid** (in-person and virtual) **joint** ([5B06](https://anc5b06.com) and 5C07) **SMD meeting**.
- **We'll have presentations** from **the Commissioners**, **Aurora Market**, **Xscape Restaurant Lounge**, and the developers of **1800 Hamlin St NE**
- Any other community updates or suggestions welcome

## Background
**This is a joint meeting of SMDs 5B06 and 5C07** to be held on **3/22/2023** starting at 7pm. **The meeting will be hybrid;** in person at Woodridge Library and virtually over Microsoft Teams.

Single-Member District meetings are:
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners
- a chance to discuss issues with their immediate constituents
- not a venue for any official actions
- more common in some parts of DC than others

## Physical Location
The meeting will be at Woodridge Library (1801 Hamlin St. NE), upstairs in Conference Room B. The room has a 20-person capacity. We'll continue to improve our hybrid meeting techniques, hopefully using a camera tripod and hooking up to the conference room television this time.

There will be a children's craft/play corner set up.

## Virtual Connection Details
The meeting will be available virtually on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).

## 1800 Hamlin St NE (Pleasant Grove Baptist Church)
This project was previously briefed to a 5C07 Single-Member District on July 13th, 2022 ([video](https://dcnet.webex.com/webappng/sites/dcnet/recording/6ce78429e525103abbff005056813512/playback)).

At that time, the plan was for
- 66 rental homes
- with around 90% Affordable (income-restricted) (AMI mix to be decided)
- and a two-story church space (with no homes above it) on the north end of the lot

They were seeking a voluntary [Design Review](https://dcoz.dc.gov/page/design-review) case with the Zoning Commission, all together seeking:
- a little more height in areas of the building
- variance on loading zone requirements
- variance on minimum off-street parking requirements

The latter two variances above could be done through a Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) case, but can also be rolled into a single case through the Design Review process. The taller height (presumably acheived through some averaging of allowable height for the zone) requires a Design Review (or could otherwise require a more substantial ZC case, such as a Map Amendment).

The limiting factors cited for the loading zone and parking relief were the lot size and shape, and the desire to make the building more transit- and pedestrian-friendly.

## Notification History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact avenues on the footer of this webpage.
