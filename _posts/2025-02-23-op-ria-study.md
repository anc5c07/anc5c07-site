## tl;dr
- **DC’s Office of Planning (OP) recently kicked off a [study of Rhode Island Ave NE](https://publicinput.com/riaps)** from 13th St NE to Eastern Ave NE
- **Councilmember Parker secured $200k in the FY25 budget** for this study
- **This was primarily responsive to advocacy by DC Squared,** which operates the Rhode Island Ave Main Street program
- **In many ways, this is an update to [a 2010 study on Rhode Island Av](https://planning.dc.gov/publication/rhode-island-avenue-diamond-district-small-area-plan)**, which, among other things, recommended the zoning changes that enabled MRP’s Bryant St development, and creation of the Main Street program itself
- **Councilmember Parker also seeks to fund some recommendation in the FY26 budget**, which would allow for very quick actualization of the results of this study; I really appreciate this ambitious move
- **The first Community Open House will be Saturday, March 1, 1pm** at Art Enables, 2204 Rhode Island Ave NE
