## tl;dr
- DDOT [plans to install a right-in/right-out diversion](https://ddotwiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NI/pages/2518155269/NOI-24-115-TESD) at the intersection of Franklin St NE and 17th St NE
- This will be a physical median that restricts driving straight through Franklin St NE on 17th St NE
- It will also restrict all left turns here (from Franklin to 17th and vice versa)
- This will reduce "cut-through" traffic on 17th St NE and curtail the constant driver/driver crashes here
- Unfortunately, it won't do much to slow down speeds on Franklin St NE
- I attempted to expand the scope in [my written response to the NOI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBlhVYecqbi-5LdVyhxb19vqXSLEC4Lm/view), which contains many more details
