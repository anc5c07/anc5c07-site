**The Spring 2025 project will now focus solely on the Langdon Rec Center mural;** we'll put the Woodridge Library mural on the backburner for now, while I focus on pushing DDOT Curbside Management Division on provisioning new ADA spaces on Hamlin. The page will be updated soon.
{: .notice--danger}

## tl;dr
- **A group of neighbors led by Rachel Deussom is dedicating their time and skills to create murals [in front of Langdon Rec Center](#in-front-of-langdon-rec-center) and [in front of Woodridge Library](#in-front-of-woodridge-library)** under [DDOT’s Arts in the Right-of-Way (AROW) program](https://publicspaceactivation.ddot.dc.gov/pages/arow), which actively encourages such installations
- **These activations [have a number of benefits](https://ggwash.org/view/98106/family-biking-matters-make-streets-safer-with-art)**, including placemaking and [safety improvements](https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/43/2022/04/Asphalt-Art-Safety-Study.pdf)
- **I'm seeking ANC 5C support** for both the public space permitting, as well as ANC 5C funding for materials to actuate the murals
- **[Opposition from Woodridge Civic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10XMa-M9Oz8m3jJ8LkJ5fipMu3xK5AhVL/view) and resulting hesitation from at least four other 5C Commissioners** has so far presented a hurdle to securing that support and funding
- **[A survey on the initial drafts received 122 responses](https://forms.gle/1KgJFfqkKGcCwjSV9)** and the design team is actively working to integrate the feedback ahead of a [a 5C07 SMD meeting](#april-2nd-5c07-smd-meeting-info)
- **I've made and [widely distributed/posted a flyer](https://x.com/vj5c07/status/1905640917148533000) to raise awareness** with a QR code directing here; you can [help distribute](https://anc5c07.com/flyers/)!

## April 2nd 5C07 SMD meeting info
Responsive to a fellow 5C Commissioner's request, I'll be holding an "SMD meeting" on this topic ahead of the April 10th ANC 5C meeting.

**Single-Member District meetings are:**
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners to their immediate constituents
- historically a cultural norm in central Ward 5, though unusual elsewhere in DC
- not a venue for any official actions

## mural locations

The proposal is to paint "Closed Roadway" murals in two locations. The project would add paint to the asphalt within permissible areas per DDOT's standards, and would not permanently alter the existing installations in any physical way beyond paint on asphalt.

### in front of Langdon Rec Center
The Langdon Park Community Center is located at 2901 20th St NE, fronting 20th St NE where it bisects Langdon Park (also known in whole or part as Chuck Brown Memorial Park).

[![Langdon Park Crossing](/assets/images/langdon-crossing/complete.png)](/assets/images/langdon-crossing/complete.png)
<p class="caption">The Langdon Park Crossing, a raised crosswalk with curb extension and Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons</p>

As of April 2024, a raised crosswalk surrounded by flexpost curb extension connects Langdon Park across 20th St NE here. My own advocacy for this improvement dates back to [years before I was Commissioner](https://x.com/VJKapur/status/1569763615573692417), though I've spoken neighbors fighting for vertical mitigations here for decades. The urgency was highlighted after [a February 2023 crash here killed 22-year-old Andy Cariño](https://anc5c07.com/issues/20thst/).

<!--#### a brief history of the traffic safety install
Langdon Park is built on top of a piped stream, and consequently is set at the nadir of steep hills on both sides. Prior to February 2023, a flat mid-block crosswalk with no ADA access ramps connected the park across 20th St NE. This roadway condition, coupled with low parking utilization and non-delimited centerlines on the roadway, made speeding through Langdon Park a longtime problem. Neighbors have long advocated for safety improvements to this stretch of roadway, including multiple requests as part of the All4Allie campaign to submit traffic safety requests in honor of five-year-old Allie Hart, whom a driver killed a few blocks outside of 5C07 on September 13th, 2021.

### in front of Woodridge Library
Woodridge Library is located at 1801 Hamlin St NE, at the confluence of Rhode Island Ave NE, 18th St NE, two disjoint fragments of Hamlin St NE, and several vestigial fragments of Queens Chapel Rd NE (most of which became part of 18th St NE).

As of September 2024, a curb extension established by a combination of flexposts and “Qwick Kurb” on the Hamlin St NE crosswalk closest to the library hardens driver turns off Rhode Island Ave NE and protects this crosswalk from parking encroachment.

[![Woodridge Library curb extension](/assets/images/woodridge-library/curb-extension-complete.png)](/assets/images/woodridge-library/curb-extension-complete.png)
<p class="caption">The Woodridge Library curb extension</p>

My own advocacy for this improvement [dates back to at least 2022](https://x.com/VJKapur/status/1569344363167383553), before I was Commissioner, but the problems with this vestigial connector have long been known and thought about. During the library reconstruction planning in 2012, [there was a proposal to extend the library plaza into this roadway segment](https://woodridgedclibrary.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/plaza-on-hamlin-street/), though sufficient coordination with DDOT was later deemed infeasible.

## designs

### version 1.0 designs
The initial designs were [first made available on February 21, 2025](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AY74O5EteBKnLJaNGibSjZlu_oQAA-Gy/view), and an accompanying survey yielded 122 responses before closing on March 24, 2025. Survey responses included many pieces of constructive and concurring advice advice. 25 respondents indicated a desire to contribute going forward, and all of them were added to the distro for the two subsequent Design Review meetings. Videos of the meeting are available below under [Meeting History](#meeting-history)

### version 1.2 designs
A version 1.2 set of designs were shared with the design volunteering team ahead of two Design Review meetings held on March 27th (virtual) and March 29th (hybrid at Woodridge Library).

### version 1.4 designs
Version 1.4 will be presented at the 5C07 SMD meeting on 4/2.

## approval process
As it stands, I'm planning to move forward with two votes in ANC 5C before proceeding to public space permitting, with the next opportunity at our April 10th meeting:
- **a motion to support the public space permitting:** DDOT requires "ANC support" for individuals pursuing AROW permitting; at present, this would be an unaffiliated group, and I'm interpreting this requirement to mean *Commission* support and not just *Commissioner* support. Should we fail to secure this support, volunteers might need to organize under a new or existing organization to proceed
- **a motion to finance the project:** The estimated cost of this project sits at $2,500. It is a permissible expense on which 5C can spend some of its ~$135,000 in savings (with around ~$20k coming in annually). Should 5C not provide financing, alternative funding sources would be needed.

With that support or with alternatives on one or both bullets, the next major step would be submission of the public space permitting application, which is [governed by DDOT's policies and processes](https://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/page_content/attachments/AROW%20Program%20Guidelines.pdf). DDOT and other agency reviewers may come back and request changes.

The goal is to install in Spring 2025.

## concerns
This project is controversial, and, as of our March 13 meeting, a majority of 5C Commissioners expressed an unwillingness to move forward citing Woodridge Civic's concerns. I'll attempt to summarize and respond to some of these concerns.

### about my involvement or characterizing this project as a "done deal"
I do not have "done deal" in my vocabularly; things in this town are done once they're done and critically at risk until then, especially when they depend on volunteer labor. I would also never mischaracterize Full-Commission or Public Space permitting approvals that had not yet occurred.

As with so many things, there continues to be some confusion on the role of Commissioner and how representative democracy works in general. While I engage in many avenues of public outreach, I am not legally bound to do so; only politically. None of the body of governing documents for ANCs generally or ANC 5C specifically have a concept of a "Single Member District meeting" or otherwise prescribe any particular methods of outreach.

I believe moving forward with these murals is true to the platform on which I was elected and the oath of office I swore, and do not anticipate changing my mind absent compelling arguments beyond the stated positions of those able to make it to any given meeting.

I'm proud to have been a supporter of this concept since inception. As I'm neither a designer nor a painter, I have had virtually no feedback or involvement in the design process, but am happy to lead on ushering the project through ANC 5C and subsequent permitting matters, and this is what I plan to continue doing.

### about the curb extensions or further modifying them
Concerns have been raised about the benefits of the new curb extension installs, and also that the mural projects may in some way modify. **The proposal is only to add paint to the asphalt**; all flexposts and quick-kurb will remain in the existing placement once the project is completed.

It is no secret that I have been a strong advocate for both installations for many years, and I firmly believe both installations are a significant improvement to the safety of all roadway users. While I'm always happy to discuss that, it's not directly at subject. If you have specific concerns about the curb extensions, I can add them here with responses.

### about whether this is a good use of money
Concerns have been raised about whether the money would be better spent elsewhere. As this project is currently less than 2% of 5C's available funds, and I'm *strongly* in favor of spending down those funds before they're at risk for redistribution to other communities (as occurred in the 2013 redistricting cycle, but not in 2023), I would love for folks to specify those other projects and help secure the proposal, permissibility concurrence, and Commissioner consensus necessary to deploy those funds within the time runway these processes will take. Difficulty in doing this is the reason we have such a large cache of savings in the first place.

### about whether murals are safe
It's been suggested that murals might entice children into the roadway or distract drivers. There is [strong evidence of the opposite](https://www.americansforthearts.org/news-room/art-in-the-news/new-study-highlights-how-the-arts-make-streets-safer).

### about conflict with the Langdon Rec Center modernization
[As of early February's DPR Ward 5 Capital Project Update Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5xtOfesMuE), DPR's timeline for the $31M Langdon Rec Center modernization is to begin construction in Spring 2026. Under that timeline, construction is a year away.

On the feasibility of the Spring 2026 timeline:
- It's likely Spring 2026 was optimistic even with the fiscal outlook as it was in early February; the recent long-delayed Fort Lincoln groundbreaking is demonstration of that. DPR indicated a plan to host four additional community meetings on design, which would be conducted by a team that is still under procurement
- Since early February, DC's fiscal outlook has gotten considerably worse. While I join neighbors in wanting to see this project held harmless in the tough times ahead, there are many reasons to think the $31M project would slip even further than typical for a DPR capital project.
         
On proceeding even with a Spring 2026 construction timeline:
- The Langdon Rec Center mural would be in four parts, two on each side of 20th St NE. Under the assumption that construction will not be shutting down 20th St NE to through traffic, it seems unlikely all four pieces would be impacted by construction.
- Should one or two pieces be affected by construction and that asphalt remain available upon project completion, we can simply restore the artwork. This would be a smaller lift both in labor and deliberation than it was the first time.
- Residual concerns might be with making the investment now only to have to partially reinvest later; see concerns about whether this is a good use of money above.

On contributory benefit to the rec center project itself: 
- DOEE's grant process allows for additional funding added to existing capital projects to deal with water management issues. DOEE personnel has indicated the space occupied by the Langdon Rec curb extensions might be a good candidate for bioswales, which could be included as part of the Rec Center modernization.
- Installing the murals now benefits the proposal of bioswales here in that it would lessen the visual impact and adjustment, which has been contentious in other parts of town where it was proposed to mitigate serious drainage issues

## outreach

(Nevertheless, the Hamlin St segment was closed during construction.)

During the September 2022 All4Allie campaign, before I was Commissioner, I submitted TSI SR (number) seeking to close this segment of roadway. I was inspired by the DDOT-initiated roadway segment closure in front of Truesdell Elementary School, installed after a driver hit a child with a car there.
