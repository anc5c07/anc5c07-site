## tl;dr
- **[DDOT’s Arts in the Right-of-Way (AROW) program](https://publicspaceactivation.ddot.dc.gov/pages/arow) facilitates and encourages painting murals on our public roadways**, subject to its permitting standards
- **These activations [have a number of benefits](https://ggwash.org/view/98106/family-biking-matters-make-streets-safer-with-art)**, including placemaking and safety improvements
- **Recently installed curb extensions** [in front of Langdon Rec Center](#in-front-of-langdon-rec-center) and [in front of Woodridge Library](#in-front-of-woodridge-library) create candidate locations for AROW “Closed Roadway” murals
- **Neighbor Rachel Deussom is dedicating her time and skills** to create murals in both locations, and recruiting fellow neighborhood volunteers
- **I'm seeking ANC 5C support** for both the public space permitting, as well as ANC 5C funding for materials to actuate the murals
- **Opposition from Woodridge Civic and resulting hesitation from at least four other 5C Commissioners** has so far presented a hurdle to securing that support and funding, but I’m hopeful to build more support through further engagement and design iteration, so that we might complete the project in Spring 2025
- **[All can provide feedback on the initial drafts](https://forms.gle/1KgJFfqkKGcCwjSV9)** and we'll be having a 5C07 SMD meeting on the topic at 7pm on Thursday, April 4th (all virtual)

## locations

The proposal is to paint "Closed Roadway" murals in two locations. The project would add paint to the asphalt within permissible areas per DDOT's standards, and would not permanently alter the existing installations in any physical way beyond paint on asphalt.

### in front of Langdon Rec Center
The Langdon Park Community Center is located at 2901 20th St NE, fronting 20th St NE where it bisects Langdon Park (also known in whole or part as Chuck Brown Memorial Park).

As of April 2024, a raised crosswalk surrounded by flexpost curb extension connects Langdon Park across 20th St NE here.

<!--#### a brief history of the traffic safety install
Langdon Park is built on top of a piped stream, and consequently is set at the nadir of steep hills on both sides. Prior to February 2023, a flat mid-block crosswalk with no ADA access ramps connected the park across 20th St NE. This roadway condition, coupled with low parking utilization and non-delimited centerlines on the roadway, made speeding through Langdon Park a longtime problem. Neighbors have long advocated for safety improvements to this stretch of roadway, including multiple requests as part of the All4Allie campaign to submit traffic safety requests in honor of five-year-old Allie Hart, whom a driver killed a few blocks outside of 5C07 on September 13th, 2021.

### in front of Woodridge Library
Woodridge Library is located at 1801 Hamlin St NE, at the confluence of Rhode Island Ave NE, 18th St NE, two disjoint fragments of Hamlin St NE, and several vestigial fragments of Queens Chapel Rd NE (most of which became part of 18th St NE).

As of September 2024, a curb extension established by a combination of flexposts and “Qwick Kurb” on the Hamlin St NE crosswalk closest to the library hardens driver turns off Rhode Island Ave NE and protects this crosswalk from parking encroachment.

(considerations for closing Hamlin St NE for a larger plaza, ultimately dismissed due to coordination difficulties)

(Nevertheless, the Hamlin St segment was closed during construction.)

During the September 2022 All4Allie campaign, before I was Commissioner, I submitted TSI SR (number) seeking to close this segment of roadway. I was inspired by the DDOT-initiated roadway segment closure in front of Truesdell Elementary School, installed after a driver hit a child with a car there.
