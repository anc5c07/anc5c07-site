This project is in 5C05 on the bounding roadway of 5B04; both ANCs 5C and 5B have automatic party status and Great Weight.
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- This is a proposed 8-home building with 4 parking spaces
- There is currently a detached home with no parking spaces on the site
- Due to procedural shortcomings inherent in SMD-based Commission organization, neither ANC has weighed in formally

## BZA proceedings
This case is being heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, which hears cases involving small zoning variance.

| agency | case | summary | next hearing | ANC status | case status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [BZA](https://dcoz.dc.gov/bza/about) | [20927](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Home/ViewCase?case_id=20927) | Allow increase in density in RA-1 | 7/19/2023 | none taken; likely too late | no action yet |

Any increase in density in an RA-1 zone requires an exception of this type; there is no additional relief being sought beyond matter-of-right uses in an RA-1 zone.

Some important artifacts from the case record include:
- **[Applicant's Statement](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=307324):** The justification for the relief being sought, prepared on behalf of the applicant by land-use attorneys
- **[Updated Architectural Plans and Elevations](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/BZA/20927/Exhibit17.pdf):** Detailed renderings and the applicant-prepared zoning analysis
- **[OP report](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=316754):** Office of Planning's analysis and recomendation, which is to approve the subject application

## ANC proceedings
This property is in Single-Member District 5C05, which is represented by Commissioner Darlene Oliver. It's on the bounding roadway with Single-Member District 5B04, which is represented by Commissioner Ra Amin.

When a case is on the ANC boundary, both adjacent Commissions have "automatic party status" and their recommendations carry Great Weight. As 5B and 5C both rely on SMD Commissioners to handle cases within their SMD in all policy areas, reacting to this case and bringing the matter before each Commission was primarily a task for Commissioners Oliver and Amin.

The applicant made every effort to engage with both 5C and 5B. While attempts were made in both Commissions to learn about the project, and a presentation to ANC 5C did occur on July 12th (a special meeting convened in part due to this case and its hearing the next week), neither Commission passed a recommendation or report. The final reason for this, in the July ANC 5C meeting, was Commissioner Oliver's absence (due to a medical emergency).

As a response, nearby Commissioners from the three surrounding Commissions have drafted [a sign-on letter](#anc-sign-on-letter) voicing some advocacy for more homes and less vehicle parking, but otherwise being supportive.

## Plans
The property is currently improved by a small detached single-family home. The plan is to raze this structure and build an eight-home building.

<p class="caption">renderings of the building</p>

The alley-facing rear is currently improved with raised landscaping and no off-street parking; the proposed plans will grade this down and create four alley-facing parking spaces.

### Inclusionary Zoning
Typically, developers building multifamily buildings in DC need to set aside some floor area for Affordable Housing (per [Inclusionary Zoning](https://planning.dc.gov/inclusionaryzoning)), and receive some bonus density for doing so. In an RA-1 zone, the maximum matter-of-right Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is **.9**, but a building providing IZ homes can build up to **1.08** (a 20% increase). The Floor Area Ratio is the ratio of occupied floor space (Gross Floor Area, which doesn't include cellar levels or the penthouse) to the lot area.

IZ is only required when a building reaches ten homes, and this one only includes eight. The building can voluntarily include IZ with bonus density as part of zoning relief, or, likely possible in this case, the extra density could put the building at ten homes (or more) in any case. At ten homes, likely one would be set aside for IZ (10-12.5% of the floor area of a wood-frame building).

Per the Applicant's statement and zoning analysis, the building is below the maximum allowed height for the zone and well below the maximum lot coverage, even without seeking any additional zoning relief, primarily by building more on the rear of the proposed building:

|Standard|Required Min/Max|Proposal|
|---|---|---|
|Height, Stories|40 ft., 3 stories|33 ft. 6 in.|
|FAR w/o IZ|0.9|0.9|
|Floor Area w/o IZ|4,455 SF|4,455 SF|
|FAR w/IZ|1.08|N/A|
|Floor Area w/IZ|5,346 SF|N/A|
|Lot Occupancy (%)|40%|32%|
|Lot Occupancy (SF)|1980 SF|1593 SF|
|Side Yards|8.4 feet|8 ft. 6 in.<br/>9 ft. 6 in.|
|Rear Yard|20 ft.|55 ft.|

### Parking Requirements
Typically, a residential building in DC requires one parking space per three homes after the first four.

This building has 8 homes as planned, so: 

**(8 - 4) ÷ 3 = 1.333** which rounds to **1**.

Because this building is close to multiple transit lines, including the Rhode Island Ave metro and high-frequency buses, there is a reduction by a half, though this doesn't change the outcome due to rounding:

**((8 - 4) ÷ 3) ÷ 2 = 1.333 ÷ 2 = .666** which rounds to **1**.

It would be possible for the developer to seek zoning relief to maintain no parking spaces on the property. It also would be easy to only build one. Instead, the developer is proposing to build four.

## Community Action
[Anyone can submit comments](https://dcoz.dc.gov/node/1211256) in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the BZA when judging the application. I would be happy to help regardless of your position, especially if you are a 5C05 resident, so feel free to reach out if you aren't sure what to write. You may also choose to speak at the hearing, but you will have to submit written comments either way.

### Submitting a Letter
To submit a letter:
- send before 9:30am **Tuesday 7/18/2023** to be sure it's received in time
- email it to **bzasubmissions@dc.gov**
- include the case number (`BZA 20927`) and address (`1015 Rhode Island Ave NE`) in the subject
- including some information about your proximity to the site, and/or residency within 5C05 if applicable, may help strengthen the weighing of your comments

>
> I do, however, want to express concerns about the construction of four new vehicle spaces on this property, where none are now and only one is required for this number of homes. This building is well-served by transit, and providing this parking would increase the cost of these homes and could induce car ownership that wouldn't otherwise occur, hindering our long-term climate and traffic safety goals.

## ANC sign-on letter

> Chairperson Hill and members of the BZA:
> 
> This letter is on behalf of ourselves and our constituencies, and not our respective Commissions. The subject property sits in Single-Member District 5C05 on the bounding roadway with 5B04, making both ANCs 5C and 5B automatic parties to the case. The subject property is also approximately 1200 feet from the 5F boundary. As no Commission has voted on, or submitted, an official report into the record, we, as individual Commissioners from the three Commissions, are assembling thoughts here for consideration by the BZA.
> 
> We lament that the community input process was not conducted in normal order, and do not blame the applicant or their representatives. As they’ll no doubt demonstrate, they performed quite a bit of outreach, including emails to both Commissions beginning in April and a presentation delivered to ANC 5C on July 12th, at a Special Meeting convened, in part, to cover this case ahead of the July 19th hearing.
> 
> While we are generally proponents of building new homes in our neighborhoods, and will appreciate any outcome that produces a net seven new homes, we have concerns with the specific plans in this case.
> 
> Among the concerns:
> - This proposal does not provide for Affordable Housing units through Inclusionary Zoning.
> - In not seeking the bonus density through IZ, the proposal is creating fewer homes overall.
> - The proposal is not fully utilizing the matter-of-right height or lot occupancy allowances, where the aforementioned additional housing could be provided
> - This proposal, as planned, would provide three parking spaces in excess of zoning requirements, when the building is adjacent to transit and errand-serving amenities
> 
> Taking opportunities to add additional housing in this location is critical, given:
> - the aforementioned adjacency to transit and errand-serving amenities
> - a recognized shortage of housing locally, regionally, and nationally in transit-accessible locations
> - a limited number of surrounding areas where small multifamily projects are readily allowed
> - The underutilization of surrounding neighborhood schools, as outlined by the Office of Planning report on this application
> 
> Being judicious on the ratio of homes to vehicle parking spaces is important, as:
> - the cost of constructing and maintaining these spaces will convey to future residents and further decrease the affordability of these homes
> - attaching these spaces to homes might induce future car ownership and vehicle volume in contrast to DC’s long-term environmental and transportation safety goals
> 
> For these reasons, we request that the BZA compel the applicants to revisit this proposal and consider more housing and/or less parking, as they move forward on this vital project.
>
