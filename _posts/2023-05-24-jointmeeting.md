{: .notice--info}

**This is a joint meeting of SMDs 5B06 and 5C07** to be held on **05/24/2023** starting at 7pm. **The meeting will be hybrid;** in person at Woodridge Library and virtually over Microsoft Teams.

Single-Member District meetings are:
- optional outreach efforts by Commissioners
- per cultural norms, a precondition to bring official actions to 5B and 5C
- a chance to discuss issues with their immediate constituents
- not a venue for any official actions
- more common in some parts of DC than others

### Why are these joint meetings?
Commissioner Piekara and I do joint meetings because our community is split down the center by the Commission boundary along Rhode Island Ave, the epicenter of our community's housing production, retail/commercial activity, and street safety issues. Most obligatory ANC casework in our SMDs is shared by ANCs 5B and 5C with both being affected/party ANCs; having a joint meeting provides cross-pollinated awareness of both Commission's activities and avoids redundant meetings on the same topics.

## Physical Location
The meeting will be at Woodridge Library (1801 Hamlin St. NE), upstairs in Conference Room B. The room has a 20-person capacity.

### Notes for folks there physically:
- Presence in the meeting room is consent to be recorded and made part of the meeting record (without the luxury of mute/video-off buttons)
- You may want to join on your phones in the room to have access to the chat and other online tools online participants have access to.

## Virtual Connection Details
The meeting will be available virtually on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).

- **Passcode:** yCndRL

### Notes for folks there virtually:
- Mind your mute and video-off buttons; opening access is consent to be recorded and made part of the meeting record
- Our audio equipment isn't particularly high-end; crosstalk in the room will admittedly be hard to follow on the line sometimes even when we're doing our best
- There won't always be someone on camera; we know it's annoying to watch an empty whiteboard, but we're juggling a lot of stuff

### Or call in (audio only)
