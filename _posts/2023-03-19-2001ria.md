## tl;dr
- **2001 Rhode Island Ave NE is a 14,810 square foot lot** at the southeast corner of 20th and RIA
- **Local Teamsters union chapters** most recently occupied the building currently on the site
- **The building was sold in late May** to [July Residential](https://www.julyresidential.com/), which initially planned a matter-of-right building with 50 homes and no retail
- **After some community advocacy for retail**, the added 4500 SF of retail to the plans
- **Complicated topology and rear access** requires some parking relief for the site, which is well-served by bus
- **We can and should also advocate for building as much new sidewalk as possible** along Rhode Island Ave NE, both during the zoning case and subsequently during the Public Space permitting

## Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The site is categorized as Residential Moderate Density (RMOD)/Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) in the Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map (FLUM). It is currently zoned MU-4.

For context, the slightly smaller nearby plot containing DC Dragons is slated for a matter-of-right project for 59 homes and no retail (and around 15 parking spaces).

## BZA proceedings
This case is being heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, which hears cases involving small zoning relief.

This case was originally scheduled for 3/6/2024, but was postponed after overlapping issues were raised by me and DDOT concerning the retaining wall remaining in public space along RIA in the renderings. DDOT is also requiring a traffic study that the Applicant needed more time to complete.

### parking
There may be revisions associated with this aspect of the project that will be discussed at the 3/27 meeting and/or in filing ahead of the 5/8 BZA hearing.
{: .notice--danger}

*(will spell out parking matters here shortly; tl;dr is they're planning to build two vehicle parking spaces while required to build somewhere around 8-14 depending on how we're calculating; there was also some flux in the two spaces last I heard an update).*

The parking relief is necessitated by the unique topology and poor access to the site, which can only be accessed via a paper alley in the rear. More details in [the Applicant's Statement in the Zoning case record](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=327713).

### sidewalk
This development is chance to expand the sidewalk along Rhode Island Ave here, which is a pinchpoint in our otherwise wide-sidewalk retail corridor from 20th St NE to 24th St NE.
