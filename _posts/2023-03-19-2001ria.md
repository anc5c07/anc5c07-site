{: .notice--danger}

## tl;dr
- **2001 Rhode Island Ave NE is a 14,810 square foot lot** at the southeast corner of 20th and RIA
- **Local Teamsters union chapters** most recently occupied the building currently on the site
- **The building was sold in late May** to [July Residential](https://www.julyresidential.com/), which initially planned a matter-of-right building with 50 homes and no retail
- **After some community advocacy for retail**, the added 4500 SF of retail to the plans
- **Complicated topology and rear access** requires some parking relief for the site, which is well-served by bus
- **We can and should also advocate for building as much new sidewalk as possible** along Rhode Island Ave NE, both during the zoning case and subsequently during the Public Space permitting

## Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The site is categorized as Residential Moderate Density (RMOD)/Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) in the Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map (FLUM). It is currently zoned MU-4.

For context, the slightly smaller nearby plot containing DC Dragons is slated for a matter-of-right project for 59 homes and no retail (and around 15 parking spaces).

## BZA proceedings
This case is being heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, which hears cases involving small zoning relief.

This case was originally scheduled for 3/6/2024, but was postponed after overlapping issues were raised by me and DDOT concerning the retaining wall remaining in public space along RIA in the renderings. DDOT is also requiring a traffic study that the Applicant needed more time to complete.

### parking
There may be revisions associated with this aspect of the project that will be discussed at the 3/27 meeting and/or in filing ahead of the 5/8 BZA hearing.
{: .notice--danger}

*(will spell out parking matters here shortly; tl;dr is they're planning to build two vehicle parking spaces while required to build somewhere around 8-14 depending on how we're calculating; there was also some flux in the two spaces last I heard an update).*

The parking relief is necessitated by the unique topology and poor access to the site, which can only be accessed via a paper alley in the rear. More details in [the Applicant's Statement in the Zoning case record](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/ViewExhibit.aspx?exhibitId=327713).

### rear setback
There is some uncertainty about the setback compliance in the design on the northeastern side of the building (the "rear" from 20th St NE), again complicated by the unique topology of the site. The Applicant is likely seeking relief here to minimize later risk.

### sidewalk
This development is chance to expand the sidewalk along Rhode Island Ave here, which is a pinchpoint in our otherwise wide-sidewalk retail corridor from 20th St NE to 24th St NE. This issue will mostly be decided during a subsequent Public Space permitting case and hearing on that, though we can advocate now and push BZA to include maximal flexibility in public space rearrangement as part of any BZA approvals towards the goal of wider sidewalks or better activation of the raised area.

## Community Action
[Anyone can submit comments](https://dcoz.dc.gov/node/1211256) in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the BZA when judging the application. I would be happy to help regardless of your position, so feel free to reach out if you aren't sure what to write. You may also choose to speak at the hearing, but you will have to submit written comments either way.

### Submitting a Letter
To submit a letter:
- send before 9:30am **Tuesday 5/7/2024** to be sure it's received in time
- email it to **bzasubmissions@dc.gov**
- include the case number (`BZA 21067`) and address (`2001 Rhode Island Ave NE`) in the subject
- including some information about your proximity to the site, and/or residency within 5C07/5B06 if applicable, may help strengthen the weighing of your comments

A template to start might be:

> `Subject: ` Letter in (Support/Opposition) of BZA 21067, 2001 Rhode Island Ave NE

>Chairperson Hill and members of the BZA:
>
>This letter of (support/opposition) is in regard to Board of Zoning Adjustment case 21067, relief related to minimum parking and rear setback requirements
>
>I (do not) believe the BZA should allow this building to be constructed, because (reasons).
>
>Very respectfully,<br/>
>(your name)<br/>
>(your address or SMD)

### Template in full support with consideration for public space flexibility
This is a position one may wish to take:

> `Subject: ` Letter in Support of BZA 21067, 2001 Rhode Island Ave NE

>Chairperson Hill and members of the BZA:
>
>I fully support the parking and rear setback relief sought for this subject building. I support the construction of these homes and new retail, and am not concerned about the parking and setback issues created by the unique topology of this site.
>
>That said, I do hope public space matters related to the retaining wall and raised "public parking" area fronting our retail corridor on Rhode Island Ave NE might evolve to allow for further sidewalk widening and retail activation of the public space. To allow for this as plans evolve, I hope the BZA will allow for maximum flexibility on rearrangement of the retaining wall, steps, and ramp, such that reconfiguration would not require a later BZA Modification of Consequence.
