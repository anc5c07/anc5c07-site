This is an expected future development with no active plans or cases.
{: .notice--warning}

## tl;dr
- **2001 Rhode Island Ave NE is a 14,810 square foot lot** at the southeast corner of 20th and RIA
- **Local Teamsters union chapters** most recently occupied the building currently on the site
- **The building was sold in late May** to [July Residential](https://www.julyresidential.com/), which has indicated an intention to redevelop the property
- **The developer is skeptical of building retail** on the site in addition to homes, but I'm working with various community groups to make the case for retail
- **Without any zoning relief, there could be around 50 homes** developed on the site, and this would not involve any community input; I strongly believe this would be a wasted opportunity to build more homes and other community-serving amenities
- **The Public Space permitting process** will also give us a chance to advocate for benefits like wider and safer sidewalks around the property

## Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The site is categorized as Residential Moderate Density (RMOD)/Commercial Moderate Density (CMOD) in the Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map (FLUM). It is currently zoned MU-4.

## Outreach History
I can't guarantee perfect conveyence of information to every stakeholder on every occasion, but I do my best to both diversify outreach and log all of it for auditability. I'm also available through the contact methods on the footer of this webpage.
