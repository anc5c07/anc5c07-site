This project is in 5C02.

## tl;dr
- **The Model Cities building** is a government-owned facility at **1901 Evarts St. NE** leased to service providers for senior residents' needs
- There are [plans to expand](https://dgs.dc.gov/page/dacl-model-cities-wellness-center-expansion) this facility to increase services offered
- **The Engine Company 26 building** (1340 Rhode Island Ave NE) is **planned for retirement**; it's no longer the appropriate size or located far east enough to accomodate current population size/distribution
- **There are multiple options for replacing the firehouse**; including placing [a new one in Fort Lincoln](https://dgs.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dgs/event_content/attachments/ATTACHMENT%20A2%20-TECHNICAL%20REQUIREMENTS%20AND%20SUBMITTAL.pdf), or colocating one with Model Cities
- **The [notional Model Cities/FEMS plan](/issues/modelcities/#langdonwoodridge-e26-plans)** would pave over a considerable amount of forested area in our neighborhood and create a lot of emergency vehicle traffic on our streets, presumably making traffic safety mitigations more difficult

## background
### Model Cities
I still need to collect some information on the history and current uses of Model Cities.
{: .notice--info}

#### Some sources
- [official page](https://www.seaburyresources.org/model-cities-senior-wellness-center) at Seabury Resources website
- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Cities_Program) on the Great Society/War on Poverty program that bears the same name; possibly this building's genesis is related to that federal program?

#### Official description
> Model Cities Senior Wellness Center offers a variety of comprehensive programs, classes and activities designed to educate and promote active and healthy aging for older adults in DC. Free for DC residents 60 years of age and older. Come join us to learn, socialize, and engage in some fun healthy activities!

### Engine Company 26
I still need to collect some information on the history on the plans to move Engine Company 26.
{: .notice--info}

#### Some sources
- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_Company_26_(Washington,_D.C.)) on Engine Company 26 (interchangeably refers to the FEMS company and the historically preserved building it currently occupies)
- [DGS project page](https://dgs.dc.gov/event/dcam-19-ae-rfp-0024-architecturalengineering-services-fire-and-emergency-medical-services-fems) containing various RFP elements related to building a new Engine Company 26 facility in Fort Lincoln (though there are also references to Brentwood)

#### My citationless understanding
The current E26 building is not large enough to support current population needs. It's also not centrally located enough for the service area, which now includes many new residents/buildings in Fort Lincoln (around the Costco).

[![E26 service area](/assets/images/modelcities/fems-service.png)](/assets/images/modelcities/fems-service.png)
<p class="caption">E26 service area, captured from <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/apps/DCGIS::fire-and-ems-station-locations/explore">Fire And EMS Station Locations</a> at OpenDataDC</p>

In the above map, you can see the service area extending through Fort Lincoln, with the station (the west-most pin in the region) all the way to the west side. The other two pins are FEMS warehouse and fleet facilities, not dispatch facilities.

## Langdon/Woodridge E26 Plans
At the [8/3/2022 5C07 SMD meeting](/issues/20220803-5c07meeting/), Commissioner Montague discussed receiving a very preliminary plan for a possible DC FEMS station in 5C02, just across Evarts from Langdon Elementary School.

These particular plans would include:
- razing the existing Model Cities building at 1901 Evarts St NE, and replacing it with a new two-story complex with similarly-sized surface parking lot, accessed by one curb cut on Evarts St.
- paving over a large portion of forest patch, similar to the officially designated [Langdon Park Forest Patch](https://biologistsoup.wordpress.com/2022/10/04/a-little-more-about-langdon-forest-patch/).
- possibly intruding on two [paper streets](https://wamu.org/story/20/02/17/paper-streets-arent-real-but-they-can-lead-to-big-problems-for-developers/), notional portions of 20th St NE between Evarts and Channing, and Douglas St NE between Queens Chapel Rd and 20th, that were never built (this *might* require Council action to allow)
- building a FEMS station there, with a large surface parking lot in back, accessed by a second curb cut on Evarts
- building a vehicle bay on the east side of the FEMS station, with emergency vehicles accessing from a third curb cut on Queens Chapel Rd

### my take
switching from facts to opinion
{: .notice--warning}

I have some major concerns with this, including:
- putting a loud emergency vehicle dispatch right outside Langdon Elementary School, which would disrupt the learning environment
- putting a loud emergency vehicle dispatch adjacent to a senior living facility and family shelter, which would also be disruptive
- having emergency vehicles use 20th, Queens Chapel, and/or Franklin for egress; Commissioner Montague mentioned a community benefit of this would be more aggressive snow removal on the roads here, which I'm not compelled by at all. We need traffic calming where 20th St. cuts between Langdon Park's playground and rec center (and everywhere else), and I'd worry that additional emergency vehicles would be used by DDOT to justify not acting on that.
- having additional curb cuts on a sidewalk where children are likely to be walking; I'm not sure why the two parking facilities couldn't share a curb cut or be consolidated entirely
- removing parts of the [forest patch](#the-forest-patch), which would be problematic enough, but also primarily to add surface parking lots, which is an inherently poor use of the land. If this much parking is really necessary, this might be a candidate for a second underground parking garage in the neighborhood, after the one at [2026 Jackson](/issues/2026jackson/)

[![DC Government Property](/assets/images/modelcities/no-trespassing.png)](/assets/images/modelcities/no-trespassing.png)
<p class="caption">DC Government Property sign at the site</p>

We should monitor this situation closely. These are DC Government buildings replacing a DC Government building, which allows both more flexibility in use, but also ideally a little more community control. We should work to make sure new construction there is community-serving and pedestrian/transit-oriented, and these plans are neither.

## 8/25/2022 Public Space Committee hearing
Some plans related to this project and driveways were summarily approved by the DC Public Space Committee on 8/25/2022, but it's not clear what.

The hearing [agenda](https://pschearing.dc.gov/documents/024ee4d3bbb94619a8db588471a3f98e/explore) and [video/transcript](https://transcripts.gotomeeting.com/#/s/f8b6751004ad161c402a136ee4c23b4e883dfbb52fed5700d3e658ff71f63053) are available online. The case was summarily approved as part of the consent agenda at around the 16:20 mark.

The agenda item reads as follows:

> 7) - EVARTS STREET NE AND QUEENS CHAPEL ROAD NE - Permittee: DC Department of General
> Services c/o Emeka Nwabunwanne - Owner: DC Department of General Services c/o Emeka Nwabunwanne -
> Paving: Driveway(s) Close Existing, Driveway(s) New- Commercial # 395238

The permit now appears as `Approved Pending Payment` in the TOPS system. You can view it [here](https://tops.ddot.dc.gov/DDOTPermitSystem/DDOTPermitOnline/Reports/PublicConstructionPermitReport.aspx?tn=395238), though there are very few details there as well. The permit start date is **1/1/23** and end date is **3/31/23**; it's unclear exactly what the scope of this work is. I'm presuming/hoping this would be related to the existing Model Cities building and not any reconstruction effort, given the timeframe.

[![Langdon FEMS proposal](/assets/images/modelcities/fencing.png)](/assets/images/modelcities/fencing.png)
<p class="caption">Construction Fencing (taken 10/3/2022)</p>

I will attempt to get more information on this particular application/permit and report back. There is already construction fencing erected at the site.

## The Forest Patch
Thanks to Allison Clausen and Delores Bushong, Langdon Park Forest Patch volunteers, for helping with the below.
{: .notice--info}
The E26 plans would disrupt a forest patch that currently sits in the area.

Unlike the [Langdon Park Forest Patch](https://biologistsoup.wordpress.com/2022/10/04/a-little-more-about-langdon-forest-patch/), which is officially designated and already protected as part of Langdon Park, the patch of forest that these plans would disrupt does not have a name. For now, I'll be using the shorthand **Douglas Street Forest Patch**, after one of the [paper streets](https://wamu.org/story/20/02/17/paper-streets-arent-real-but-they-can-lead-to-big-problems-for-developers/) it covers.

[![Real Property Map](/assets/images/modelcities/plats.png)](/assets/images/modelcities/plats.png)
<p class="caption">Platted land, snapshotted from DC's <a href="https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=9a5c11c11dd347cc9c05d64499cc98ee">Real Property Map</a></p>

The Douglas Street Forest Patch covers the entirety of two undeveloped DC-owned plots, part of the plot containing the Model Cities and Office of Aging facilities, and four paper street segments (20th, Douglas, Channing, and Park Ave). The Model Cities building and Office of Aging facilities are to the west, with a shuttle parking facility nestled in the middle of the forest patch. [Langdon Elementary School](https://www.langdonelementaryschool.org/) is across Evarts to the north, and [The Ionia Whipper Home](http://ioniawhipperhome.org/about-us/) (a shelter for families experiencing homelessness) and a few detached houses are around Park Ave to the south.

The forest patch is currently the site of frequent dumping, is minimally maintained, and is surrounded by uninviting No Trespassing/Dumping signs.

[![Forest Patch](/assets/images/modelcities/forest.jpg)](/assets/images/modelcities/forest.jpg)
<p class="caption">Forest patch, looking north from Park Ave NE</p>

The forest patch sits on a slope and absorbs/filters stormwater that would otherwise flow to the PDR Zones at the bottom of the hill, ultimately reaching Hickey Run and then the Anacostia. It absorbs particulate matter and noise pollution from the PDR zones and nightlife establishments to the south (that would otherwise affect the seniors and students). It cools the air, offsetting the area's extreme [heat island effect](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/urban-heat-islands/). It helps towards [DC's 40% canopy goal](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/62580ba81fc34563b1bae8e8416ee16d) and plays a part in [slowing climate change](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/insights/how-forests-fight-climate-change/). It also provides habitat for migratory species and supports DC's ecosystem. Research also shows living near trees makes people [happier](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/12/2804) and [healthier](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/09/scientists-have-discovered-that-living-near-trees-is-good-for-your-health/).

All of this is particularly important here in Ward 5, which has outsized share of DC's PDR zones and has experienced [dramatic canopy loss in recent years](https://caseytrees.org/get-involved/conservation-easements/).

Efforts could conceivably be made to clean up, nurture, and protect this forest patch, while making it available to visitors as with the recently built 680-foot Langdon Park Forest Patch trail.
