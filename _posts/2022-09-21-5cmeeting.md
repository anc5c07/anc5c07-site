## DC Water
There was already some talk from Commissioner Montague related to water issues on [September's 5C07 SMD meeting](issues/20220907-5c07meeting/#water-issues).

Commissioner Montague mentioned that DC Water had been invited to the SMD meeting, but did not attend. The invite pertained to a case on Mills Ave. with a resident experiencing issues with a spring that was buried pre-1900; there was some confusion as to whether DC Water or the resident had responsibility to mitigate issues brought to light after recent heavy rain.

He went on to say DC Water would present to 5C on easements and underground infrastructure that may not be properly recorded in their maps. Commissioner Montague is helping to properly map these forgotten underground artifacts.

Flooding is a big [active issue](https://twitter.com/7NewsDC/status/1557480266112835585) caused by poorly understood interior flood risk and extremely high rain volumes. I think DCist explains the overarching issue well [in this piece](https://dcist.com/story/22/08/11/why-does-rhode-island-ave-keep-flooding/).

A key quote for me:
> DOEE is currently working on an integrated flood map, that will include interior flood risk, in addition to the flood risk coming from the rivers. It’s a lot of work, and expensive, Bonard says, because it involves understanding and mapping the topography, hydrology and stormwater infrastructure of the entire city.
>
> “If a drop of rain falls on this piece of pavement, where does it go?” Bonard says. “Which catch basin does it flow into? How large are the pipes that it flows into? What other pipes do those pipes connect to?”

[A piece in Bygone Brookland](https://bygonebrookland.com/2018/10/08/a-river-used-to-run-through-it/) also explores the network of brooks and creeks in our area that were buried, which may also be pertinent to consider.

## Bladensburg Bus Garage
This will be an update on WMATA's [Bladensburg Bus Garage project](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Bladensburg/index.cfm), which will rebuild the existing bus facilities between the B&O Railroad tracks and Bladensburg Rd. NE (along 26th St. NE).

The new bus faclities will improve accomodations, capacity, and infrastructure for future improvements such as electric buses. Until complete, buses are being kept on part of the [NewCityDC](https://douglasdevelopment.com/properties/new-city-dc/) development site.

## BZA 20779 - 1224 Brentwood Road NE
[This case](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/CaseReportPage.aspx?case_id=20779) is for a new four-unit residential building on the site of an existing detached house within an RA-1 zone. Relief is sought to increase density within the RA-1 zone, as well as allow a continuous parking bay in back (without any screening to reduce individual openings to less than 20 feet wide).

The case had a [BZA hearing on 9/14/2022](https://play.champds.com/dczoning/event/386/s/11418), where the applicant expressed difficulty getting on the agenda for meetings of either SMD 5C05 or ANC 5C, and presented a timeline of attempts. The Board expressed reticence to approve without some comment from the ANC and more outreach to a nearby church regarding parking.

Commissioner Montague, there for the subsequent case (covered below) expressed that some turnover in the Commission's officers resulted in the difficulty with scheduling and consideration. The case was scheduled for another hearing on 10/19/2022, with an extra two weeks to allow time for the outreach and briefing the ANC.

## BZA 20780 - Eastlack residence
This is a [small BZA case](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/CaseReportPage.aspx?case_id=20780) to repair/replace an old porch in kind, necessitated by poor DCRA recordkeeping. The new porch would be within the same footprint as the old one and similar to adjacent existing porches.

This case was [also heard by the BZA on 9/14/22](https://play.champds.com/dczoning/event/386/s/14057); Commissioner Montague testified to his support, but expressed concern that the case was not heard by the whole ANC. The board did not think it was necessary for this to occur, and the board approved the application.

## ANC 5C - Quarterly Report
This is presumably a financial briefing on the Commission budget.

## DPR - Recreation Center's Status Update
It is unclear what Recreation Center this is in relevance to, but there are near-term plans to renovate the Langdon Park Recreation Center.

## Other things that might come up
- [2026 Jackson St. NE](/issues/2026jackson/) received its first of two votes at the Zoning Commission on 9/19/2022; all Comissioners (minus one vacancy) voted in favor of the map amendment, and no further information was requested.
