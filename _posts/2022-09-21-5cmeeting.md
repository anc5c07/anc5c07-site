## tl;dr
- **MPD's 5th District** has a new Inspector (rank between Captain and Commander); **Inspector Sylvan Artieri**. **Captain Chris Moore has moved** to a different District.
- **Council email addresses** are moving from `dccouncil.us` to `dccouncil.gov`; emails should forward but it's **best to update your contact lists now**.
- **DC Water will need to shut off water overnight one night in Gateway** around 28th and Bladensburg Rds. NE in the next couple weeks to complete the last tie-in of a water main replacement project.
- **The [Northeast Boundary Tunnel project](https://www.dcwater.com/nebp) is continuing**, but Commissioners are upset that it won't solve various water-relatd issues in our neighborhoods
- **WMATA's [Bladensburg Bus Garage project](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Bladensburg/index.cfm) is continuing**; the fencing has a neighborhood-honoring wrap that Commissioner Montague helped design
- **BZA Case [20779](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/CaseReportPage.aspx?case_id=20779) to create a four-unit residential building** in Brentwood remains in limbo because the applicant has **not been given an opportunity to present to an SMD meeting yet**
- **There are many recreation/community center construction projects** and DPR updates on each were read (eventually)

## MPD report
This started with the personnel announcement that Captain Chris Moore was not longer assigned to 5th District, and Inspector Altieri is there to brief. Commissioner/Chair Manning was not pleased about this surprise and Inspector Altieri apologized. Lieutenant Joseph Devlin was also present.

A few issues were discussed:
- updates on recent crimes such as thefts from vehicles and warnings not to leave valuable in vehicles
- mentioning MPD's [Crime Cards](https://crimecards.dc.gov/) visualizer to check on some crime statistics
- discussion on a lack of School Resource Officers resulting in teens loitering and fighting in areas instead of being escorted to buses
- There was a community question about clubs having events; one of the officers detailed that clubs are required to have a security plan, and those involve hiring MPD officers to work club security (on duty with overtime reimbursed by the clubs; not paid for by taxpayers). There was an event at Echostage that night, and there would be six officers there for 6-7 hours.
- Commissioner Oliver asked about the Brentwood/Edgewood feud; Inspector Altieri said it's mostly calmed down, though there was one incident attributable to a misunderstanding of sorts

## DC Water
I have yet to update this post-meeting to reflect all that actually occurred.
{: .notice--warning}

There was already some talk from Commissioner Montague related to water issues on [September's 5C07 SMD meeting](issues/20220907-5c07meeting/#water-issues).

Commissioner Montague mentioned that DC Water had been invited to the SMD meeting, but did not attend. The invite pertained to a case on Mills Ave., where a resident experienced issues with a spring that was buried pre-1900; there was some confusion as to whether DC Water or the resident had responsibility to mitigate issues brought to light after recent heavy rain.

He went on to say DC Water would present to 5C on easements and underground infrastructure that may not be properly recorded in their maps. Commissioner Montague is helping to properly map these forgotten underground artifacts.

Flooding is a big [active issue](https://twitter.com/7NewsDC/status/1557480266112835585) caused by poorly understood interior flood risk and extremely high rain volumes. I think DCist explains the overarching issue well [in this piece](https://dcist.com/story/22/08/11/why-does-rhode-island-ave-keep-flooding/).

A key quote for me:
> DOEE is currently working on an integrated flood map, that will include interior flood risk, in addition to the flood risk coming from the rivers. It’s a lot of work, and expensive, Bonard says, because it involves understanding and mapping the topography, hydrology and stormwater infrastructure of the entire city.
>
> “If a drop of rain falls on this piece of pavement, where does it go?” Bonard says. “Which catch basin does it flow into? How large are the pipes that it flows into? What other pipes do those pipes connect to?”

[A piece in Bygone Brookland](https://bygonebrookland.com/2018/10/08/a-river-used-to-run-through-it/) also explores the network of brooks and creeks in our area that were buried, which may also be pertinent to consider.

## Bladensburg Bus Garage
I have yet to update this post-meeting to reflect all that actually occurred.
{: .notice--warning}
This will be an update on WMATA's [Bladensburg Bus Garage project](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Bladensburg/index.cfm), which will rebuild the existing bus facilities between the B&O Railroad tracks and Bladensburg Rd. NE (along 26th St. NE).

The new bus facilities will improve accomodations, capacity, and infrastructure for future improvements such as electric buses. Until complete, buses are being kept on part of the [NewCityDC](https://douglasdevelopment.com/properties/new-city-dc/) development site.

## BZA 20780 - Eastlack residence
Commissioner Montague briefly walked the Commission through this case, but there was no action necessary as it was already approved.

This is a [small BZA case](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/CaseReport/CaseReportPage.aspx?case_id=20780) to repair/replace an old porch in kind, necessitated by poor DCRA recordkeeping. The new porch would be within the same footprint as the old one and similar to adjacent existing porches.

This case was [also heard by the BZA on 9/14/22](https://play.champds.com/dczoning/event/386/s/14057); Commissioner Montague testified to his support, but expressed concern that the case was not heard by the whole ANC. The board did not think it was necessary for this to occur, and the board approved the application.

## ANC 5C - Quarterly Report
I have yet to update this post-meeting to reflect all that actually occurred, but it was only substantive in how dysfunctional it was.
{: .notice--warning}
This is presumably a financial briefing on the Commission budget.

## DPR - Recreation Center's Status Update
There were multiple rounds of debate and dysfunction on whether to read an email from Tommie Jones (Chief of External Affairs, DPR) that was sent to the Commissioners around 30 minutes before the meeting. Commissioner/Chair Manning had not read the email and therefore did not consider it appropriate to have it read. Commissioner Hicks Delgado raised motions to have it read into the record due to it pertaining to her constituents' concerns about Community Center renovations, and she was eventually successful in getting it read. Commissioner Montague read the update, which included the following status updates on 5C-wide capital projects:

- **Arboretum Community Center:** DPR continues to work on final inspections and punchlist items; the faclity should be open to the public this fall
- **Fort Lincoln Park Community Center:** DGS working on awarding contract for new facility. There will be a community kickoff event for construction after the contractor is selected; that should be this fall
- **Theodore Hagans Cultural Center:** because of ongoing pandemic and correlated construction costs, this was removed from the scope of the Fort Lincoln Park project. The hope is that this concession can focus resources on the park itself. As such, the Theodore Hagans Cultural Center will continue being open to the public for the foreseeable future in its current state
- Funding for the **Langdon Park Recreation Center** does not kick in until FY23. We anticipate Spring 2023 as the likely timeline for the start of the project.
- **Dakota Playground** was resurfaced in Winter 2021; DPR has no funding for any work on that at this time (this was presumably in response to a request for work to be done on resurfacing the playground)

There was some discussion on whether to invite DPR for the 10/5 meeting. Commissioner Hicks Delgado wants them to be there, but Commissioner/Chair Manning says they have to discuss offline.
