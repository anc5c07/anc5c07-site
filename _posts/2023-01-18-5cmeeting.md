## tl;dr
- **This is the first meeting of the new term**, and will establish Officers and schedules.
- **This meeting has not yet occurred.** This page serves as a notice and preview.
- I will be filling in more details here before the meeting to help folks come into the meeting aware of the topics
- After the meeting, I will update this page with a summary of takeaways, and some annotations on the agenda with what was discussed

## Meeting Details
The meeting will be held virtually (via WebEx or Teams) at **6pm ET** on **Wednesday 1/18/2023**. It will be the first meeting of the new Commission, and the first with the new boundaries and district makeup. The most recent regular meeting of ANC 5C was on [11/16/2022](/issues/20221116-5cmeeting/) (with short follow-ups on 11/21 and 11/30)

This is an official 5C meeting. Whole-commission meetings are:
- open to the public
- noticed to the public ahead of time by seven days and multiple approved methods
- require a quorum of Commissioners present (in person or on camera)
- the only suitable venue for official Commission actions (e.g. voting on resolutions/letters)

In addition, as the first meeting of the new term, this meeting will establish officers and procedures, as well as meeting scheduling, for the next year.

The meeting will initially be led by a temporary Chair Pro Tempore, until an official Chair is elected.

### Connection details
These have yet to be established, but will be set up soon.
